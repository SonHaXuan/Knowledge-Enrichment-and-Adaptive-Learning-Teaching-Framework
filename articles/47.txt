ABSTRACT

KEYWORDS

This study surveyed people’s knowledge and use of central bank digital currency (CBDC), crypto
asset ownership, and cash demand in Japan. While 4% of the respondents understand CBDC, 10%
are willing to use CBDC when available. The demographic characteristics of respondents who
understand CBDC are similar to those of crypto asset owners. Average cash demand for day-to-day
payment purposes by crypto asset owners is slightly lower than that by nonowners. If CBDC users
had similar cash demand to that of crypto asset owners, the introduction of CBDC with attributes
similar to crypto assets would not substantially reduce cash demand for day-to-day payment
purposes.

1. Introduction

The global economy is transitioning into
a digitalized economy, and new Internet services
have emerged in many industries. In the financial
industry, crypto assets like Bitcoin have been gain­
ing attention.1 Thus far, economists have opined
that crypto assets are unsuitable means of daily
payment and unlikely to replace legal tender
because first, their prices are volatile, which is dif­
ficult to theoretically explain (e.g. Goczek and
Skliarov 2019; Qiao, Zhu, and Hau 2020; Kapar
and Olmo 2021), and second, before payment com­
pletion is confirmed, Bitcoin takes time to reach
a consensus. Third, the process consumes substan­
tial electricity, which hurts the environment.
However, central banks have considered issuing
central bank digital currency (CBDC) in
a digitalized economy. Retail CBDC may replace
coins and bills with digital currencies in smart­
phone applications. The share of central banks
actively engaged in some form of CBDC work
grew to 90% in 2021 (Kosse and Mattei 2022).
Central banks in major countries have considered
issuing CBDC (European Central Bank 2020;
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
2022a; Bank of Japan 2020) and proposed steps to
achieve effective CBDC systems (Bank of Canada,

Riksbank, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank,
Board of Governors Federal Reserve System, and
Bank for International Settlements 2021) because
of domestic payments efficiency, payments safety,
and financial stability. Financial regulators in
major economies have announced comprehensive
public policy principles to adapt CBDC in the
global economy (G7 2021). Four developing coun­
tries (Cambodia, Bahamas, Nigeria, and Jamaica)
issued CBDC between 2020 and August 2022.
One of the difficult policy questions on CBDC is:
Will CBDC replace cash? This question has been
researched in theoretical and empirical studies.
Theoretically, CBDC demand depends on the
attractiveness of alternative forms of money and
the design of CBDC issuance, such as anonymity
(the traceability of transactions), security, transac­
tion limits, and interest earned (Mancini-Griffoli
et al. 2018). Both cash and crypto assets have the
attractiveness of anonymity, which might compete
with CBDC. One should also consider the substitu­
tion among CBDC, commercial bank deposits with
the attractiveness of security from theft and loss,
and cash. Agur, Ari, and Dell’ariccia (2022) con­
sidered an economy where agents sort into cash,
CBDC, and bank deposits according to their

preferences over anonymity and security, and
where network effects make the convenience of
a payment instrument depend on the number of
its users. In their model, a CBDC designed with
attributes similar to those of cash may lead to the
disappearance of cash. Behind these analyses lie
extensive literature that discusses the relationship
between anonymity preference and demand for
digital payment instruments (see Uno, Sonoda,
and Bessho 2021; Acquisti, Brandimarte, and
Loewenstein 2020; Acquisti, Taylor, and Wagman
2016). In particular, Athey, Catalini, and Tucker
(2017) found through an experiment that those
who say they care about privacy are willing to
relinquish private data quite easily when incenti­
vized to do so. Their results suggest that predicting
the demand for payment instruments based on
self-reporting general anonymity preference may
not be helpful if agents choose the payment instru­
ment under some specific contexts, say, rewards.
Using data from current mobile payment users in
China, Hu, Liu, and Yan (2021) showed that priv­
acy risk, defined as users’ perceptions of potential
negative outcomes, including collecting, transmit­
ting, and selling the information of individuals, is
negatively related to users’ overall evaluation of
facial recognition payment based on a trade-off
between the perceptions of benefits and costs.
Given that a small number of economies have
issued CBDC, empirical data on CBDC in circula­
tion are limited. Thus, consumers’ adoption and
use of CBDC can be predicted either by surveying
and identifying the demographic characteristics of
consumers who are aware of CBDC and willing to
adopt CBDC or by laboratory experiments.2 First,
what product characteristics associated with widely
accepted payment methods should CBDC possess
to be widely used as much as cash (Huynh et al.
2020; Lii 2021; Fujiki 2021a)? Second, if the crypto
asset owners or users of non-cash payment meth­
ods have demographic characteristics similar to
that of potential CBDC users, are these owners’/
users’ cash holdings smaller or larger than those of
non-users (Balutel et al. 2022; Khiaonarong and
Humphrey 2022)? The second approach requires
data on the cash holdings of crypto-asset owners or
non-cash payment methods and the owners’/users’
2

demographic characteristics, compiled in the
Bitcoin Omnibus Survey in Canada (Balutel et al.
2022). However, such data are not available in
Japan. Third, a laboratory experiment on the
choice of hypothetical payment methods that differ
in three attributes – illiquidity risk, the expected
return, and anonymity – showed that anonymity is
relevant in shaping the demand for money.
Anonymity increases the overall appeal of
a payment medium, and this effect is stronger for
risk-prone individuals (Borgonovo et al. 2021).
This paper uses the empirical results on the
substitution between crypto assets and cash and
contributes to the second approach by focusing
on CBDC’s adoption and possible substitution of
cash from the anonymity aspect. This study pre­
sents new Japanese consumer survey data on the
knowledge and potential use of CBDC, crypto asset
ownership, cash demand for day-to-day payment
and hoarding purposes, and respondents’ demo­
graphic characteristics. We first identify the demo­
graphic characteristics of crypto asset owners and
respondents who are aware of CBDC and willing to
use it. We then investigate whether crypto asset
owners have similar demographic characteristics
as those of potential CBDC users. After analysing
whether the cash demand by the crypto asset own­
ers is higher or lower than that of the nonowners,
this study concludes by providing a ballpark mea­
sure of cash demand by a potential Japanese CBDC
user based on the estimates of substitution between
cash and crypto assets.
This study closely relates to studies using
Japanese payment method choice by crypto asset
owners. Fujiki (2020) found that crypto asset own­
ers tended to use cashless payment methods, and
Fujiki (2021b) found that crypto asset owners
tended more to hoard cash than nonowners; these
studies provided no information about cash
demand.
This study contributes to the research on demo­
graphic characteristics of crypto asset ownership
and cash demand (the U.S.: Hanna et al. 2020;
Schuh and Shy 2015; Hundtofte et al. 2019; Auer
and Tercero-Lucas 2021; Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System 2022b; Canada: Huynh
et al. 2020; Balutel et al. 2022, 2022; Austria: Stix

2021; Japan: Kawamura et al. 2021; Fujiki 2020,
2021b). These studies show that crypto asset
holders are more likely to be younger and male;
this finding is consistent with that of this paper.
Compared with the last two Japanese studies, this
study also examined cash demand.
Our research also relates to Japanese studies on
cashless payment, cash usage, and cash demand
(Sekine, Shoji, and Watanabe 2022; Intage Inc
2021; Konishi 2021; Fujiki 2022; Fujiwara 2022;
Wakamori 2020; Fujiki and Tanaka 2018; Fujiki
2019); however, these studies do not examine the
amount of cash demand outstanding and crypto
asset ownerships.
2. Data

This study commissioned Intage to conduct an
online survey from 7 June 2021, to 20 July 2021,
asking questions about the use of CBDC, the
demand for crypto assets, and cash holdings from
6,000 monitors participating in the National
Consumer Panel Survey (SCI) and special payment
survey (SCI Payment). We received responses from

3

3008 respondents. To ensure a representative sam­
ple with respect to the Japanese Census population
data, SCI monitors were males and females aged
15–79 years from all the prefectures in Japan. They
were asked to report the date and time of the
purchase of food, beverages, daily necessities, cos­
metics, pharmaceuticals, and tobacco over a week.
Of the 52,500 SCI monitors, Intage randomly
selected four groups of 3,000 SCI monitors to join
SCI Payment. These monitors additionally
reported the payment methods used to purchase
the goods to add to the SCI survey. We approached
two groups of SCI monitors, a total of 6,000, who
joined the three waves of SCI and SCI Payment in
July or August 2019, October 2019, and April 2021,
to reply to our questions. From the 3,029 monitors
who agreed, we focused our analysis on 3,008
monitors after dropping those who did not report
the purchase records in either the 2019 or 2021 SCI
survey. Table 1 reports the means of the variables
related to respondents’ knowledge and use of
CBDC, crypto asset ownership, and risky financial
asset holdings. Columns (A) and (B) report the

which corrects the weight for the monitors to be
proportional to the weight of region, age, and gen­
der used in the SCI computed from the Japanese
Census; the last column (labelled N) reports the
number of observations.
2.1. Data on knowledge and use of CBDC

The variable CBDC knowledge denotes respon­
dents’ current knowledge about CBDC.
CBDC knowledge takes a value of 1, 2, and 3,
when the respondents chose the options ‘I under­
stand the details of CBDC’, ‘I have heard about
CBDC’, and ‘I have never heard about CBDC’,
respectively. Column (B) of Table 1 shows that
only 4% understand the details of CBDC, and
20% have heard about it. A Bank of Japan (2021)
survey conducted in September 2021 included the
same question, and the means of these questions
were 3% and 19%, respectively, which were similar
to our results. A Deutsche Bundesbank (2021)
study conducted in April 2021 found that 23% of
the respondents were aware of the digital euro.
CBCD future use denotes respondents’ intention
to use CBDC, if ever issued in Japan. A variable
CBCD future use takes a value of 1, 2, and 3, when
respondents chose the options ‘I want to use
CBDC’, ‘I don’t want to use CBDC’, and ‘I don’t
know’, respectively. Column (B) of Table 1 shows
that only 11% want to use CBDC. In Deutsche
Bundesbank (2021) and Bijlsma et al. (2021), 40%
and about 50% of the respondents expected to use
the digital euro in the future, respectively. The
percentage of options in CBCD future use classified
by the CBDC knowledge is shown in Figure 1,
which reveals that a person who understands
CBDC is more likely to use it.
2.2. Data on crypto asset ownership

Table 1 also reports the means of the variables on
crypto asset ownership, Crypto owner. Crypto
owner is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1
for those who selected the options ‘I used to use or
own crypto-assets in the past but do not currently
use or own’, and ‘I currently use or own cryptoassets’ (Current owner). Crypto nonowner is
a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 for those
who selected the options ‘I understand what

Figure 1. Understanding and usage of CBDC. Source: Author’s
calculations.

crypto-assets are, but I have never used or owned
one’, ‘I have heard of crypto-assets but have never
used or owned them’, and ‘I have never heard of
crypto-assets and have never used or owned them’.
Table 1 shows that the weighted average value of
Crypto owner is 0.089. Similar results were obtained
in two Japanese surveys: the Financial Literacy
Survey (hereafter, FLS 2019) conducted by the
Central Council for Financial Services
Information in March 2019 for 25,000 Japanese
individuals aged 18–79 years revealed that Crypto
owner is 7.8% of the respondents (Fujiki 2020). The
2020 edition of Japan’s Personal Assets Database
(hereafter, RADAR 2020), a survey of 3,026 men
and women aged 20–74 years within a 40-km
radius of the Tokyo metropolitan area conducted
at the end of June 2020 showed Crypto owner is
6.5% of the respondents (Fujiki 2021b). For inter­
national comparisons, 5% of the US respondents
currently own or have previously owned crypto
assets (Hundtofte et al. 2019). In Canada, it was
5% (Huynh et al. 2020), while in Austria, it was
1.5% (Stix 2021).
Future crypto ownership uses the respondents’
reply to the question ‘What percentage of
Japanese people do you think will own crypto
assets 30 years from now?’ Future crypto ownership
takes values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 if the respondents
chose options ‘I don’t know’, ‘less than 10%’, ‘10%
to less than 25%’, ‘25% to less than 50%’, ‘50% to
less than 75%’, and ‘75% to 100%’. For this ques­
tion, the respondents were informed that crypto
assets are virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tesser. Respondents
were also told that according to various recent
surveys, the percentage of Japanese who own

APPLIED ECONOMICS

crypto assets is around 5–10%. Table 1 shows that
50% chose ‘I don’t know’, and 20% expect crypto
asset holdings less than 10% (less than or equal to
the current level of crypto asset holdings). The
remaining 30% expect more adoption of crypto
assets by Japanese people in 30 years.
Future crypto ownership is based on the follow­
ing question by Balutel et al. (2022) posed to
respondents who are aware of Bitcoin: ‘How likely
do you think that the Bitcoin system will survive or
fail in the next 15 years?’ Balutel et al. (2022)
regarded answers to this question as a proxy for
beliefs about the use of Bitcoin in the future and
presented a model that shows that a person with
a higher value of belief tends to adopt Bitcoin.
2.3. Data on risky financial asset holding

Table 1 reports the variable RA_own that captures
respondents’ holding of conventional risky finan­
cial assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and for­
eign currency-denominated financial products).
A dummy variable RA_own takes a value of 1 for
respondents who selected the option ‘I used to use
or hold these products in the past but do not use or
hold them now’ and ‘I currently use or own’. In
constructing RA_own, we focus on 2,560 respon­
dents after dropping 328 respondents who chose ‘I
have never used or owned these financial products
and have never heard of them’ and 120 respondents
who chose ‘I do not want to answer’. The average of
RA_own is 0.58, which is consistent with FLS 2019,
which reports RA_own to be 0.6 according to Fujiki
(2020) and with RADAR 2020, which shows that
53.3% of the respondents have experienced owning
16 types of risky financial assets (Fujiki 2021b).
A dummy variable for risky financial asset non­
owners No_RA_own is defined as 1-RA_own.
Because crypto asset owners with and without
conventional risky financial assets differ in their
financial literacy (Fujiki 2021b), the crypto asset
ownership variable, Crypto owner, and conven­
tional risky asset ownership variable, RA_own, for
2,560 respondents were combined. Both is
a dummy variable for those who take values of 1
for both Crypto owner and RA_own (average is
0.08, hereafter). CR_only is a dummy variable for
those who take values of 1 for Crypto owner and 0
for RA_own (0.02). RA_only is a dummy variable

5

for those who take values of 0 for Crypto owner and
1 for RA_own (0.51). Both no is a dummy variable
for those who take values of 0 for both Crypto
owner and RA_own (0.40).
2.4. Demographic and control variables

Table 2 reports the means of demographic and
control variables.
Variables for ten areas of residence (Hokkaido,
Tohoku, Kanto, Keihin, Hokuriku, Keihanshin,
Tokai, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu, with the
base case being the Keihin region, which includes
Tokyo), ages of respondents (Age_Q, which takes
the value of 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75 for respon­
dents aged below 29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69,
and above 70 years, respectively), gender of the
respondents (Female; the base case in the following
regression is male), occupation and employment
status of the respondents (Full-time, Part-time,
Temp (temporary or contract employee)), Selfemployed, House (stay-at-home mom/dad),
NoStuOth (the sum of Student, No job, and Other
job, where the base case in the following regression
analysis is NoStuOth), and educational attainment
(Edu_Q, which takes the value of 12 for senior high
or below and unknown, 14 for vocational college
and junior college, 16 for university, and 20 for
graduate) were used.
The household annual income of the respondents
(Income_Q) in ranges were classified. It takes the
value of 2,000, 4,750, 6,250, 8,000, and 10,000 for
respondents whose household annual income (in
units of million yen) is 0–2, 2–4, 4–5.5, 5.5–7, 7–9,
and over 9. The value of 0 was also assigned for seven
respondents who chose ‘I do not know the house­
hold annual income’; however, in the regression
analysis in Section V, these respondents were
dropped from the analysis. The outstanding amount
of financial asset holdings except for cash were used,
FA_0, FA_Low, FA_Mid, FA_High, and FA_X for
a household whose outstanding amount of financial
asset holdings (in units of million yen) are 0, 0–2.5,
2.5–10, over 10, and households who replied that
they do not know or refused to answer the question
on financial asset holdings. In the regression analy­
sis, we used FA_Low as the base case. Regarding debt
holdings, Debt_use was defined as a dummy variable
that takes a value of 1 for debt holders, Debt_no as

methods were aggregated and the proportion of the
number of purchases made by these were com­
puted as the observed payment ratio. A variable,
Cashless, which is 1 minus the observed payment
ratio of cash was created. Its average value is 0.536.
Notably, some respondents who answered our
questions on cash demand did purchase during
the one-week survey periods of SCI in 2019 but
did not purchase during the one-week survey per­
iods of SCI in April 2021, and their observed cash­
less ratio is unobservable. Thus, the number of
respondents for this question is reduced from
3,008 to 2,983.

APPLIED ECONOMICS

The financial literacy score based on the socalled Big-3 questions on financial literacy
(Lusardi and Mitchell 2014) was also used; it is
constructed from the number of correct answers
to three questions about the compound interest
rate, relationship between inflation and real value
of money, and diversified investments in stocks.
Big3 denotes respondents’ financial literacy score.
Table 2 shows that the average Big3 is 1.369 based
on the weighted sample. A comparison of the
unweighted and weighted mean shows that the
available sample observations over-represent
young and female respondents. Lusardi and
Mitchell (2014) showed that males tend to have
higher financial literacy scores, and thus our
unweighted sample underrepresents Big3. Our
average value of Big3 is lower than the average
values of Big3 of 1.7 (obtained from the FLS 2019;
Fujiki 2020) and 1.73 (obtained from RADAR
2020; Fujiki 2021b).
2.5. Data on cash holdings

Table 2 reports the means of the amount of cash
that respondents carry (Cash on hand, COH) and
the amount of cash kept at home for savings and
emergency spending (Cash at home, CAH).
Regarding COH, respondents selected an option
from the following five ranges of cash holding (in
units of yen; variables in parentheses take a value of
1 for respondents who choose the corresponding
option): 0–1,000 (COH_1k), 1,000–5,000
(COH_1k_5k), 5,000–10,000 (COH_5k_10k),
10000–50,000 (COH_10k_50k), and more than
50,000 (COH_50k_). As of March 2022, 1,000 yen
was about 8.3 U.S. dollars or 7.5 euros. The variable
COHQ, which takes values of 0.5, 3, 7.5, 30, and 50
for the respondents selecting COH_1k,
COH_1k_5k, COH_5k_10k, COH_10k_50k, and
COH_50k_, respectively, was created. Its weighted
mean is 15.83.
Regarding CAH, respondents selected an option
from the following eight ranges of cash holding
(in units of 1,000 yen; variables in parentheses
take a value of 1 for respondents who choose
the corresponding option): 0–10 (CAH_10k), 10–50
(CAH_10k_50k), 50–100 (CAH_50k_100k), 100–200
(CAH_100k_200k), 200–300 (CAH_200k_300k), 300–
500 (CAH_300k_500k), 500–1,000 (CAH_500k_1m),

7

1,000 or more (CAH_1m_), ‘Don’t know’
(CAH_dontknow), and ‘Don’t want to answer’
(CAH_NA). We also used the variable CAHQ, which
takes values of 5, 30, 75, 150, 250, 400, 750, and 1,000
for the respondents selecting CAH_10k,
CAH_10k_50k, CAH_50k_100k, CAH_100k_200k,
CAH_200k_300k, CAH _300k_500k, CAH_500k_1m,
and CAH_1m_. In creating CAHQ, propensity score
matching was used to impute the value of CAH for
respondents who chose CAH_dontknow and
CAH_NA. Respondents who reported CAH and
those who chose CAH_ dontknow and CAH_NA
were matched using all the demographic variables
explained in Section 2.4 as common covariates by the
logit model. If some variables have an absolute value of
standardized difference after matching of more than
0.1, the variable with the largest absolute value of the
standardized difference was removed and matched
again using the remaining common covariates. This
process continues until all the absolute values of the
standardized differences after matching are less than
0.1 (Austin 2011). The weighted mean of CAHQ is
115.24.
Our data are unique as we differentiate between
COH and CAH. The Survey of Household Finance
conducted by the Central Council for Financial
Services Information has recorded outstanding
amount of cash held at home since 1998; however,
it does not distinguish between COH and CAH and
does not provide data on crypto asset ownership.
Some private survey companies also survey cash
holdings, but they focus on COH. RADAR 2020
does ask whether respondents hoard cash, but not
the amount of CAH.
One of the reasons for the cash holding is pre­
ferences over anonymity. We define a dummy vari­
able Privacy that takes a value of 1 for the
respondents who chose the response option ‘I will
stop holding them if I can use financial products
which could protect my privacy’ to the question
‘What do you plan to do with the cash you keep at
home for savings and emergency expenses? Please
select all that apply’. The weighted mean of Privacy
is 0.032.
3. Methodology

This study employs a nonparametric test, regres­
sion analyses, and principal component analysis.

8

H. FUJIKI

A rank-sum test was used to compare cash hold­
ings across groups (CBDC knowledge and CBDC
future use) nonparametrically. Top-coded data on
COHQ and CAHQ were used; thus, the rank-sum
test suggests that the distribution of one of the
groups is skewed to the left or right but does not
determine the difference in the average amount of
COHQ and CAHQ across groups.
Second, two types of regression analyses were
used. First, regarding the respondents’ responses
for categorical variables—Crypto owner, CBDC
knowledge, and CBDC future use—a logit model
or multinomial logit model was run using
Equation (1):
Iij ¼ Xi δj þ νij ;

(1)

where Iij is the indicator variables for respondent
i for the choice of response j, Xi is a vector of the
demographic variables, and νij is an error term.
Privacy is also controlled when analysing Crypto
owner because crypto assets demand could come
from its anonymity.
Second, regarding the demand for COH and
CAH conditional on Crypto owner, Equation (2)
was estimated:
Cashi ¼ Xi β1 þ Privacyi β2 þ Crypto owneri γ
þ ui ;
(2)
where ui is an error term. Privacy is controlled
because cash demand could come from its
anonymity.
If Cash is COHQ or CAHQ, the ordinary least
square (OLS) regression was used. If Cash is COH
or CAH, the interval regressions were used. For
CAH, respondents who chose CAH_ dontknow
and CAH_NA were dropped. This study focuses
on whether the parameter estimates of γ are posi­
tive or negative to infer whether the crypto asset
owners tend to have a large amount of cash com­
pared with nonowners.
In estimating Equation (2), Crypto owner is
endogenously determined with Cash. To deal with
this problem, a vector of variables Z that are related
to the current crypto asset ownership but not
directly related to the current cash demand was
needed. Z comprising Future crypto ownership,
CBDC knowledge, and CBDC future use was pro­
posed as below.

First, Figure 2 shows that Future crypto owner­
ship is negatively correlated with crypto asset own­
ership, but this is just a future perspective about all
Japanese citizens and is not related to current cash
demand. As expected, respondents belonging to
Crypto owner and Both tend to anticipate higher
use of crypto assets 30 years in the future than
Crypto nonowner and Bothno, respectively.
Respondents who chose CR_only tend more to
choose ‘Don’t know’ compared with those who
chose Bothno. Second, CBDC knowledge was used
as respondents who have better knowledge about
the CBDC must be knowledgeable about crypto
assets and thus are more likely to have crypto
assets. This is confirmed by the top left panel of
Figure 3; however, the knowledge is not directly
related to current cash demand because CBDC has
not yet been issued in Japan. Third, CBDC Future
use was used because respondents who want to use
CBDC in the future are more likely to have crypto
assets as shown in the top right panel of Figure 3 ;
however, future CBDC demand is not directly
related to current cash demand because CBDC

has not yet been issued in Japan. The bottom two
panels of Figure 3 show that respondents who
selected CR_only are more likely to understand or
use CBDC compared with Both no but are less likely
to understand or use CBDC compared with
RA_only. Therefore, we should be mindful of the
heterogeneity within crypto asset owners by the
holdings of RA. Note also that crypto asset owners’
reply that they understand the detail of CBDC might
reflect their understanding of CBDC related to
crypto assets. However, CBDC has a more diverse
role than crypto assets; for example, it includes
wholesale CBDC, a central bank liability to com­
mercial banks. Thus, we should treat self-assessment
of knowledge on CBDC measured by CBDC knowl­
edge as the upper bound of their actual knowledge
about CBDC, because crypto asset owners might be
overconfident about their understanding of CBDC.
We use these instrumental variables in two ways.
First, we use the control function approach follow­
ing Balutel et al. (2022). We use Equation (3):
Crypto owneri ¼ PrðZi ; Xi ; Privacyi Þþ 2i

(3)

where 2i is an error term that has an independent
and identically distributed logistic distribution.
Equation (3) was estimated assuming that the link

function Pr is in logit form. The deviance residuals
of Equation (3), named U Cryptoi , was used as
a control function and the conditional cash
demand function in Equation (4) was estimated
to address the endogeneity of Crypto owner:
Cashi ¼ Xi β1 þ Privacyi β2 þ Crypto owneri γ
þ U Cryptoi δ þ ui :
(4)
Second, we employed an endogenous treatment
model that estimates (3) by probit model
and Equation (2) simultaneously using Stata 17 ere­
gress and eintreg command with entreat option.
One may wonder if Cashless, FA, and Big3 in Xi
are also endogenous variables. Cashless reflects the
choice of payment method including COH. While
the respondents replied to the questions on COH
and CAH from June 2021 to July 2021, Cashless is
measured using April 2021 spending data; thus,
Cashless is an exogenous variable.
One may doubt our instrumental variable
approach because Privacy may not be enough to con­
trol the demand for crypto assets and cash by their
anonymity. Therefore, Section 5.4 reports a principal
component analysis that examines the relationship
between the cash demand and the principal compo­
nent that best relates to crypto asset ownership.

4. Descriptive analysis
4.1. Demographic variables by CBCD knowledge,
CBCD future use, and crypto asset ownership

Table 3 reports the means of demographic variables
by CBDC knowledge, CBCD future use, and crypto
asset ownership measured by the deviation from the
weighted average responses shown in the second
column.
Regarding CBDC knowledge, respondents who
chose ‘I understand the details of CBDC’ tend to
be young and male, with a full-time job, longer
education, higher annual household income,
higher financial asset holdings, higher cashless
ratio, and a higher level of financial literacy.
Respondents who chose ‘I have heard about
CBDC’ are similar to those who chose ‘I under­
stand the details of CBDC’ except for the point that
they are more likely to be old and self-employed.
As anticipated from Figure 1, respondents who
chose ‘I want to use CBDC’ have similar demo­
graphic characteristics as respondents who chose ‘I
understand the details of CBDC’.
Regarding crypto asset ownership, respondents
who chose Crypto owner and Both have similar
demographic characteristics as respondents who
chose ‘I understand the details of CBDC’ and ‘I
want to use CBDC’ (except for Cashless in the
case of Crypto owner). The results support our
assumption that respondents who will use CBDC
have similar demographic characteristics as crypto
assets owners. Respondents who chose RA_only
also have a similar demographic characteristic as
respondents who chose ‘I understand the details of
CBDC’ and ‘I want to use CBDC’ (but respondents
choosing RA_only tend to be aged).
4.2. Cash demand by CBCD knowledge, CBCD
future use, and crypto asset ownership

Table 4 reports the weighted average of COHQ and
CAHQ, classified by the variables listed in the first
and second columns. The column labelled N
reports the number of observations used to com­
pute the weighted average of COHQ and CAHQ.
Compared with the overall weighted average of
COHQ and CAHQ, respondents who chose ‘I
understand the details of CBDC’ and CR_only
tend to have a lower weighted average of COHQ

and CAHQ. Moreover, respondents who chose ‘I
want to use CBDC’. Crypto owner, and Privacy tend
to have a higher weighted average of COHQ and
CAHQ.
Table 5 reports the results of rank-sum tests for
the group constructed by the answers to the ques­
tions on CBCD knowledge and CBCD future use.
A positive and statistically significant test statistic
suggests that the COHQ distribution for those who
chose ‘I understand the details of CBDC’ is skewed
to the left compared with that of ‘I have heard
about CBDC’. A negative and statistically signifi­
cant test statistic suggests that the COHQ distribu­
tion for those who chose ‘I want to use CBDC’ is
skewed to the right compared with those of ‘I don’t
want to use CBDC’ and ‘I don’t know’.

5. Regression analysis
5.1. Who understands the details of CBDC and
wants to use CBDC?

We used a multinomial logit model of Equation (1)
to examine which demographic characteristics
relate to the choice of ‘I understand the details of
CBDC’ and ‘I want to use CBDC’. Panel 1 of
Table 6 summarizes the estimates of marginal
effects for CBDC knowledge and CBDC future use.
In estimating the model, we began by including all
the demographic variables and then dropped the
demographic variables that were not statistically
significant for all the response categories.
Consistent with the Table 3 results, Panel 1 of
Table 6 shows that respondents with lower age,
male gender, higher educational attainment, and
a higher household annual income tend to choose
‘I understand the details of CBDC’. Moreover,
respondents with higher age, male gender, higher
educational attainment, a higher household annual
income, lower cashless payment ratio, and higher
level of financial literacy tend to choose ‘I have
heard about CBDC’. Respondents with male gen­
der, not having a temporary job, a higher house­
hold annual income, middle range amount of
financial asset holdings, debt, higher cashless pay­
ment ratio, and a higher level of financial literacy
tend to choose ‘I want to use CBDC’. Panel 2
reports the marginal effects of Cyopto owner when
we add this variable to the regressions reported in

The second and third columns specify the name of the group and the number of observations per group in the parenthesis, respectively. The fourth column
shows the variables to be tested, the fifth column shows the rank-sum test statistics, and the sixth column reports the probability value that the test statistics
are statistically significant. The null hypothesis is that the rank sum of the respondents belonging to the group reported in the column labelled Group 1 is the
same as the group reported in the column labelled Group 2. Positive (negative) test statistics suggest that the distribution of Group 1 is skewed to the left
(right) compared with Group 2. *, **, and *** show 10%, 5%, and 1% statistical significance levels of the test, respectively.

Panel 1. Positive and statistically significant mar­
ginal effects for ‘I understand the details of CBDC’
and ‘I want to use CBDC’ are consistent with our
finding in Table 3 that Crypto owner has similar
demographic characteristics as respondents who
chose ‘I understand the details of CBDC’ and ‘I
want to use CBDC’. Parameter estimates for the
other variables, not reported in Panel 2, are similar
to the results reported in Panel 1.

5.2. Demand for COH

In Table 7, column (1) reports the results of the
logit estimation of Equation (3). Columns (2) and

of Equation (4) using COHQ and COH as Cash.
Columns (4)–(7) show the results of endogenous

The first column reports the name of demographic variables and control variable, log-likelihood ratio (row labelled ll), chi-square test statistics for the null
hypothesis that all of the parameter estimates are zero (row labelled chi2), the probability value that the test statistics are statistically significant (row labelled
p), numbers of observations (row labelled N). Marginal effects are reported. Standard errors are clustered by the groups of age, gender, and region. *, **, and
*** show that the parameter estimates are statistically significant at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

number of observations N, we report pseudo
R square for the logit equation in column (1). We
report adjusted R square for the OLS regression in
column (2). For the interval regressions in column
(3), we report the log of the standard deviation of
the error term (lnsigma) in Equation (4). For the
endogenous treatment regressions in columns (5)
and (7), we report the correlation coefficient of ui
and 2i (Rho).
Columns (1), (4), and (6) show that our
Z variables, Future crypto ownership, CBDC
knowledge, and CBDC future use are statistically
significant. We use the deviance residuals
obtained from the estimates of Equation (1) for
U_Crypto. Columns (2), (3), (5), and (7) show that
Crypto owner are negative and statistically signifi­
cant. Columns (2) and (3) also show that
U_Crypto is negative and statistically significant.
The parameter estimates of Crypto owner suggest
that crypto asset owners tend to have a smaller
amount of COH by 4,000–7,000 yen than crypto
asset nonowners. Similar results are obtained
when we use Current owner, Both, CR_only
instead of Crypto owner.

Regarding the cash demand Equations (2), (3),
(5), and (7), the choice of estimation methods affects
the statistical significance of parameter estimates for
Keihanshin and Tokai, but the qualitative nature of
the remaining parameter estimates is quite similar.
Respondents with older age, male, jobs other than
part-time or temporary jobs, higher household
income, higher amount of financial asset holdings,
higher level of financial literacy, and without debt
tend to have a higher amount of COH. A Canadian
study found a negative correlation between COH
and Big3 (Huynh, Nicholls, and Zhu 2020), but
our study finds a positive correlation.
5.3. Demand for CAH

Table 8 reports the results for CAH. Columns (1)
and (2) show the results for OLS and interval
regression of Equation (4) using CAHQ and CAH
as Cash. Columns (3) through (6) show the results
of endogenous treatment regression of Equations
(2) and (3) using CAHQ and CAH as Cash. The
estimates of Equation (3) for column (1) are the
same as those reported in column (1) of Table 7,

and those for column (2) are similar to these esti­
mates. Columns (3) and (5) show that Future
crypto ownership and CBDC knowledge are statisti­
cally significant among Z variables. We notice that
the parameter estimates for both Crypto owner and
U_Crypto are positive but not statistically signifi­
cant in columns (1) and (2); however, Crypto owner
is positive and statistically significant in columns
(4) and (6). The differences between CAH by
crypto asset owners and nonowners are positive,
but the statistical significance of parameter esti­
mates of these differences is not clear. Similar
results are obtained when we use Current owner,
Both, CR_only instead of Crypto owner. Columns
(1), (2), (4), and (6) show that respondents living in
the Keihanshin area and respondents with a higher

amount of financial asset holdings tend to have
a higher amount of CAH, irrespective of the esti­
mation methods; however, for the other demo­
graphic characteristics, the statistical significance
of parameter estimates differ from equation to
equation.
5.4. Robustness checks by principal component
analysis

One may doubt the use of instrumental variable
regressions because of the control variable. For
example, Privacy may not address the demand for
cash for day-to-day payment due to anonymity
because the questions used to construct this vari­
able asks about future cash hoarding. In this

subsection, we conduct a principal component ana­
lysis and obtain a principal component whose fac­
tor loading is closely related to crypto asset
ownership. Table 9 reports the results. Thirteen
variables listed in the second column in the 5th to
17th row are used for principal component analy­
sis. These variables are selected from the results in
Table 3. The second row reports the six eigenvalues
whose values exceed 1. The third row shows the
proportion of total variance explained by the eigen­
value in columns 3–8. The fourth row shows the
cumulative proportion of variance explained by the
eigenvalue up to each column. Fifth to seventeenth
rows report the factor loadings of variables listed in
the second column for principal components 1–6.
The fifth row shows that the sixth principal

component has a higher factor loading to Crypto
owner; hence, we regard the sixth principal compo­
nent as a proxy for crypto asset owners. The last
two rows report the parameter estimates of each
principal component score that regressed COHQ
and CAHQ on the estimated six principal com­
ponent scores. The parameter estimate for the
sixth principle components score is negative
and statistically significantly correlated with
COHQ but not statistically significantly corre­
lated with CAHQ. The result suggests that
a person who looks like a crypto asset owner
judging from a higher principal component
score tends to have a lower amount of COHQ,
which is consistent with our findings in Table 7.
Note that the principal component analysis

Principal component analysis and regressions use 3,001 observations. Regarding the regression results for COHQ and CAHQ, adjusted R squared are 0.0764 and
0.0325, respectively. Constants are 15.781 and 113.318, respectively and both are statistically significantly different from zero at the 1% significance level. *,
**, and *** denote 10%, 5%, and 1% statistical significance levels by the t-test, respectively.

results are sensitive to the choice of the variables;
thus, the robustness check here is intended to
suggest an example.
6. Discussion

Bijlsma et al. (2021) found that CBDC users would
be those aged below 35 years, male, and with high
income. This study confirms their result and
shows that crypto asset owners tend to have
a smaller amount of COH by 4,000–7,000 yen
than crypto asset nonowners conditional on
respondents’ demographic characteristics. Balutel
et al. (2022) found that Canadian Bitcoin owners
hold 83% (in 2018), compared to 95% (in 2017),
more COH than nonowners. Note that their ana­
lysis did not control for the amount of financial
asset holdings, Debt_use, Cashless, and Big3. Even
dropping these variables from regressions in
Table 7, we still find that crypto asset owners
tend to have a smaller amount of COH than
nonowners.
The limitations of this study are as follows. First,
our results using self-assessment of respondents’
knowledge of CBDC should be treated as the
upper bound of their actual knowledge about
CBDC. Second, the data on COH and CAH are topcoded following the advice from Intage to increase
the number of respondents. Future works can
address this issue to compare the results with
Balutel et al. (2022). Third, while addressing the
endogeneity of Crypto owner, the other source of

endogeneity arising from conventional risky finan­
cial asset holdings and financial literacy index was
not addressed. Future works need a tractable model
of the choice of asset holdings and payment meth­
ods including CBDC and data for the plausible
instrumental variables for financial literacy.
7. Conclusion

This study presented new Japanese consumer sur­
vey data on the knowledge and potential use of
CBDC, crypto asset ownership, cash demand
for day-to-day payment purposes and hoarding
purposes, and demographic characteristics of
respondents. Our data show that 4% of respon­
dents understand CBDC, and 10% are willing to
use it. The demographic characteristics of respon­
dents who understand CBDC are similar to those
of crypto asset owners. Cash demand for day-today payment purposes by crypto asset owners tends
to be lower than that of nonowners on average but
the difference in amounts is small, about 4,000–
7,000 yen. The differences between cash hoarding
by crypto asset owners and nonowners are positive.
However, the statistical significance of parameter
estimates of the difference differs by estimation
methods, and thus, we do not have a clear conclu­
sion. Suppose the design of the Japanese CBDC is
similar to that of crypto assets in its anonymity and
the users of CBDC tend to have similar cash
demand as crypto asset owners. Then, the results
of this study suggest that the introduction of CBDC

in Japan might not reduce cash demand for day-today payment purposes.
