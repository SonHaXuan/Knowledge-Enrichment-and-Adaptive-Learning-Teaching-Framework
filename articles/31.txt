ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

There is growing debate over whether applications of blockchain and
other ﬁnancial technologies (‘ﬁntechs’) reinforce forms of neo-colonial
extraction that perpetuate North–South inequities or help enact
decolonial ambitions across the Global South. This paper expands such
discussions and contributes to this special issue on ‘ﬁntech in Africa’ by
situating emerging African blockchain techno-experimentation within
wider international infrastructural relations. We argue that blockchainbased activities in and across the African continent must be understood
within those also unfolding in countries that have been subjected to
ﬁnancial sanctions of varying types (China, Iran, Russia, Venezuela) by
the European Union, United States, and United Nations. Our analysis
traces how blockchain-based applications by sanctioned countries are
extending exclusions in novel and existing socio-technical relations. We
conclude that blockchain-based experiments are facilitating rather than
displacing a colonial ﬁnance/security infrastructure.

Introduction
Financial technologies (‘ﬁntech’) generally, and the blockchain technologies underlying ‘cryptocurrencies’ and other forms of ‘decentralized ﬁnance’ (DeFi) in particular, are being carefully and critically analyzed in the pages of this journal and beyond (Dallyn 2017, Grossman 2019, Nelms 2016,
O’Dwyer 2019). Nuanced cultural economy study of blockchain, however, has tended to focus on
applications of this set of digital technologies mainly in the Global North, where formal regulation
is rapidly evolving (Faria 2019, 2021, Faustino 2019). As part of the wider ‘turn to technology’ in
development more generally (Bernards 2019), less formal techno-ﬁnancial experimentation is
rapidly expanding across the Global South. In September 2021, the Financial Times, for example,
exclaimed that ‘developing countries provide fertile ground’ for cryptocurrencies (Wheatley and
Klasa 2021).
Claims that, for Africa in particular, the ‘future is crypto’ (Dana 2020) have been materializing in
both formal and informal experiments across the continent that are based, to varying degrees, on
the blockchain technologies underlying cryptocurrencies. Framed as a ‘liberation technology’
(Levine 2020) these blockchain-based trials ostensibly seek to fulﬁll a ‘desire for ﬁnancial autonomy’
(Handagama 2021a) from Senegal to Ethiopia, as cryptocurrency adoption by individuals is said to

be ‘blowing up’ (Handagama 2021b, Kobo 2021). Meanwhile, governments and central banks from
South Africa to Tunisia have been oﬃcially exploring blockchain-based central bank digital currency (CBDC) (Michael 2021, Handagama 2021a).1 Most prominently, the Central Bank of Nigeria
launched a CBDC trial of the ‘eNaira’ on the country’s independence day in 2021 (Iyatse 2021).
Widespread techno-euphoria has encouraged these and other experiments with blockchains as
‘the answer to Africa’s problems’ (AllAfrica InfoWire 2021).
Yet, despite considerable hype, the small but growing scale of blockchain-based ﬁntech experimentation in Africa and across the Global South raises larger and longer standing questions. Do
digital technologies actually contribute to decolonial ambitions? Does ﬁntech merely reinforce
forms of neo-colonial extraction and perpetuate North–South inequities as well as international
power asymmetries? The launch of blockchain-based ﬁntech projects and ‘education campaigns’
by foreign-based multinational organizations, such as the ‘pan-African’ cryptocurrency called the
AFRO, which was launched by a Swiss-based organization in 2018 (Afro Foundation 2021, Wright
2021), accentuate concerns over what in an earlier pre-blockchain age Herzfeld (2002) referred to as
‘crypto-colonialism’ (see also Campbell-Verduyn et al 2021, Crandall 2019, Howson 2020, Jutel
2021, Scott 2016).2
This article expands existing debates over such wider concerns by situating this special issue’s
focus on ﬁntech in Africa within wider international infrastructural relations in and beyond the
African continent. We show how the core exclusionary practice of sanctioning is being reproduced
across blockchain-based ﬁntech experiments undertaken in sanctioned countries of varying size
and geographical locations. Examining unfolding blockchain-based ﬁnancial activities in China,
Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, we place rapidly evolving eﬀorts to enact Africa as ‘the next frontier
for cryptocurrency’ (Rao 2018) in the growing shift of blockchain experimentation from Global
North to the Global South. We argue that critical cultural economy analysis of blockchain must
consider the evolving conditions under which blockchain and cryptocurrencies, adoption is emerging in, in attempts to ostensibly overcome existing power asymmetries.
In 2020, the two largest sub-Saharan African economies, South Africa and Nigeria, came in at
seventh and eighth, respectively, on a Top 10 list of leading ‘crypto-jurisdictions’ (Chainalysis
2020). This list revealed how growing blockchain-based ﬁntech experimentation across the African
continent is occurring in a wider international context being shaped by a diverse, yet very particular,
grouping of countries. Ukraine, Russia, Venezuela, and China were the top four jurisdictions identiﬁed as leading cryptocurrency adoption. Despite their diﬀerences, these four countries shared three
important features: ﬁrst, they were each subjects of international sanctions by the United States,
European Union, and United Nations; second, they are sites of systematic eﬀorts to harness cryptocurrencies or their blockchain technologies to escape these international sanctions, and; third,
they are themselves involved in what have been identiﬁed as neo-colonial forms of involvement
in Africa’s digital ﬁntech ‘frontier’ (Gravett 2020).
International sanctions are key political acts that punish through exclusions (Sullivan 2020, Giumelli 2011). They are designed to, for example, cut oﬀ access to the ﬁnancing necessary for conducting trade. A longstanding set of practices, sanctions today exclude individuals, ﬁrms, or entire
jurisdictions from international trade and credit (Giumelli 2015). They are mainly imposed on
countries in the Global South by the European Union (EU) and United States (US). Yet, China
and Russia also increasingly undertake these exclusionary practices, including through the very
blockchain technologies that we show are being harnessed to escape sanctions. Financial sanctions
are a core feature of what Marieke de Goede (2020) refers to as an international ﬁnance/security
infrastructure. Elaborating the relational understandings of the term developed in Science and
Technology Studies (STS), ﬁnance/security infrastructures are open and durable sets of relations
between human and non-human actors. Such infrastructures are, however, neither entirely open
nor completely durable: they both persistently exclude and continually change, often in ways that
are poorly understood and can even remain unnoticed. As De Goede (2020) stresses, persistent
colonial exclusions have been ‘hard-wired’ into ﬁnance/security infrastructures over time. Growing

blockchain-centered ﬁntech experimentation across the Global South, this article illustrates, re-wire
exclusionary set of relations in ways that extend rather than overcome colonial legacies of the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. We therefore inject skepticism into whether such techno-experimentation can contribute to African decolonial ambitions.
Our analysis proceeds across ﬁve sections. A ﬁrst section elaborates the STS-informed insights
informing what a second section identiﬁes as a profoundly neo-colonial existing ﬁnance/security
infrastructure. A third section then traces blockchain applications emerging in and across China,
Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. We show how this international techno-experimentation is extending
exclusionary possibilities and practices by sanctioned countries themselves who are drawing on far
less open and inclusive variants of blockchain technology. A penultimate section illustrates how
blockchain-based attempts to escape international exclusions by sanctioned countries are in turn
prompting the US and EU to further expand longstanding exclusions and power asymmetries. A
ﬁnal section re-iterates our call for cultural economy analysis to consider the decolonial possibilities
of ﬁntech by scrutinizing formal techno-experimentation across the Global North in relation to
what are often more informal trends in the Global South through STS-inﬂected notions of
infrastructures.

Infrastructural relations
Infrastructures are typically regarded as closed and static ‘things’ worthy of attention mostly for
their failures, both real and potential, such as electrical grids. In Science and Technology Studies
(STS), by contrast, infrastructures are more dynamic and evolving sets of socio-technical relations.
This relational conception sees infrastructure as an ‘on-going accomplishment’ (Feldman 2000) and
a ‘dynamic, unfolding process’ in which entanglements are ‘the primary unit of analysis rather than
the constituent elements themselves’ (Emirbayer 1997). These entanglements, as Rella (2020, p.
239) writes in the pages of this journal, are ‘always already cultural and symbolic artifacts animated
by cultures and promises associated with their use.’ In other words, infrastructural relations must
always be situated in time and place. Before elaborating on the contemporary ﬁnance/security infrastructure, we lay out four general characteristics of infrastructural relations that are essential to our
analysis of decolonial possibilities of blockchain-based ﬁntech.
First and foremost, infrastructures are characterized by openness. This openness is not absolute,
but relative. When contrasted with, for example, the far more closed digital ‘platforms’ where
speciﬁc actors are in charge of determining access (Plantin et al 2018), it is essential to stress
that no one individual or set of actors, even hegemonic states, are ‘really in charge of infrastructure’
(Star 1999). Openness, nevertheless, entails that certain states, corporations, and other non-state
actors can ‘close,’ curtail, or exclude access to infrastructural relations. What the openness of infrastructural relations means, then, is that such exclusions are never complete. As the existing ﬁnance/
security infrastructure illustrates, sanctioned entities typically still have some access to alternative
forms of international credit and possibilities for international trade. The key point here is that
there is no one central point enabling access to the evolving sets of relations that together make
up an infrastructure.
Second, infrastructures consist of durable relations that are not easily displaced or ‘disrupted.’ STS accounts emphasize the ‘installed base’ of infrastructures (Star 1999). Like their
openness characteristic, in which exclusion remains possible, durability still entails the possibility of evolution, though less revolution, in infrastructural relations. Change in infrastructures
occurs incrementally and in relation with attempts to form new infrastructural relations. In
other words, infrastructures are never entirely static ‘forever aﬀairs’; they evolve in unpredictable ways as attempts to establish ‘new’ relations are incorporated into existing relations. Infrastructural evolution can thereby stem from attempts to create more open alternatives. Yet, this
evolution is not pre-determined: change occurs in often unanticipated manners that can either
extend exclusions and undermine the openness of an infrastructure, or can expand openness

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY

and enhance inclusions in socio-technical relations. As the case of blockchain illustrates,
attempts to enact more open infrastructural relations can be re-purposed for extending exclusions in novel ways not initially considered in the founding and original development of a
technology.
A third characteristic of infrastructures is their facilitation of core activities. This feature is typically emphasized in the more general designation of speciﬁc infrastructures as ‘critical’ by policymakers (e.g. Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development 2008, Critical 5 2014).
State security concerns are central to these designations. Digital infrastructures, for example, are
‘critical’ because they make state infrastructures vulnerable to hacking and ransomware attacks.
What the notion of ‘critical infrastructure’ typically downplays, however, is a stress on the profound
entanglement between the core activities that infrastructures facilitate. Financial infrastructures, for
instance, provide (in)security through practices ranging from modeling future risks to the materiality of money itself (de Goede 2012, Gilbert 2017, Kessler 2011, Lobo-Guerrero 2016). As we elaborate below, the practice of applying sanctions illustrates the entanglements of core activities in both
an existing, as well as an emerging, ﬁnance/security infrastructure.
A ﬁnal key characteristic of infrastructures is their obscurity. In STS terms, infrastructural
relations are ‘black boxed,’ with the socio-technical nature of the relations they facilitate often backgrounded. Yet, just as periods of crisis can expose and reveal the operation of complex systems,
infrastructural relations become foregrounded as they are (re-)constructed and (re-)constituted.
This is what Pinzur (2021) refers to as ‘ongoing contributions to the web of relations and practices
that comprise an infrastructure in action.’ Finance, and particularly cross-border payments, are as
Rella (2020, p. 237) also writes ‘comparatively less “infrastructured” than domestic payments.
Hence, the dynamics at play in the design and deployment of money infrastructures can be
observed with greater clarity.’ What Rella identiﬁes as ‘money infrastructure’ can both internationalize and digitize the exclusionary degrees of longer standing, backgrounded socio-technical
relations. In foregrounding the obscure relations between human and non-human actors, the
next section assesses change and continuity in the socio-technical relations that have underpinned
a neo-colonial ﬁnance/security infrastructure.

A neo-colonial ﬁnance/security infrastructure
In an STS-inﬂected sense, then, infrastructures are open and durable sets of relations between
human practices and non-human objects that facilitate certain core activities. This understanding
of infrastructure can usefully situate the exclusions exempliﬁed by the practice of sanctioning
within longer and wider historical trajectories.
The extraterritorial application of sanctions, as existing scholarship has stressed, supports and
extends asymmetric power relations between hegemonic and non-hegemonic countries (Rodman
1995, Mallard 2019, Matera 2020). With the often silent consent of a wider group of nation-states,
represented today by the likes of the EU, sanctions by hegemonic countries such as the US contribute to and consolidate ‘neo-colonial’ legacies in relations between the Global North and Global
South. Countering the tendency in sanctions literature to theorize hegemony as distinct from
imperialism,3 however, sanctioning practices by hegemonic powers and their allies are situated
here in lineages with past practices of exclusions that were formally established in the colonial
period and have become ‘hard-wired’ into an increasingly digital era (de Goede 2020). The durability of socio-technical relations characterized infrastructural exclusions from credit under formal
colonialism is a key feature of contemporary ‘postcolonial poverty ﬁnance’ (Bernards forthcoming
2022). Despite its relative openness, today’s ﬁnance/security infrastructure persistently excludes
entire countries and tracks of the Global South.
Sanctions also extend exclusions as key practices in the facilitation of core activities by the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. Since secure access to credit ﬂowed from metropolis’ of the Global North to the Global South in the colonial era, international ﬁnancial relations have remained

528

dominated by the leading ﬁnancial centers of hegemonic powers and designed ‘to keep the least
risky, most proﬁtable activities (providing remittances, lending to government, and making
advances to large merchants or businesses) for the banks, while oﬄoading risks associated with
crop prices, disease, or bad weather onto smaller traders and, ultimately, onto peasant producers’
(Bernards forthcoming 2022). These relations of exclusion have persisted beyond the formal colonial era through activities that are typically obscured yet become more widely apparent in practices
like sanctioning. As de Goede (2020) observes, sanctions reveal ‘the unseen technical ﬁnancial payment infrastructures of global ﬁnance’ that are weaponized ‘in pursuit of particular security
agendas’ as ‘the very infrastructures of payment, ﬁnancial ﬂows, and banking access are appropriated, reformed, and rerouted through sanctions.’ Rendering international payments ‘diﬃcult,
cumbersome, and expensive,’ sanctions today continue to be ‘depriving citizens and companies
around the world infrastructurally’ (de Goede 2020).
Granted, the exclusions of ﬁnance/security infrastructural relations can serve to counter neocolonial relations. Apartheid-era sanctions on South Africa serve as a leading example here. Our
central point, however, is the very act of (dis)abling access to credit is central to the relatively –
and never completely – open ﬁnance/security infrastructure. Sanctions highlight persistent and
profound exclusions and inequalities between the Global South and Global North that have continually characterized the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure.4
A ﬁnal key point to emphasize before turning to the case of blockchain-based ﬁntech is that both
the enforcement and evasion of sanctions are imbedded in infrastructural relations between state,
non-state actors, and technical objects. On the one hand, the socio-technical relations underpinning
the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure facilitate attempts to enforce international sanctions. The
same banks ‘deputized’ (Amicelle 2011) by leading sanctioning countries to enforce ﬁnancial exclusions are often the very ones that are caught up in breaches of sanctions. Eﬀorts to enhance the
eﬀectiveness of international sanctions draw on technologies, like those digital algorithmic technologies making ‘Big Data’ (EY Global 2019), in seeking to ensure that banks do not process ﬁnancial
transactions from sanctioned entities. On the other hand, sanctioned jurisdictions also turn to digital technologies in order to escape international sanctions (Hufbauer et al 2020). Like infrastructures more generally, the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure evolves in unanticipated
manners. Technologies that identify the customers of banks and ﬁnancial services ﬁrms who are
required to conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) and to perform ‘due diligence’ checks on transactions and assess potential risks often have their very own blind spots. For instance, the Big Data
technologies embraced by international banks have not prevented the processing of customer transactions with sanctioned entities, major oversights that have led to the levying of billion dollar ﬁnes
by American regulators.5
In short, technologies, including the blockchains and cryptocurrencies we turn to next, can work
to ‘enroll’ seemingly novel practices into existing relations by both facilitating and undermining
other practices like sanctions. Importantly, however, technology on its own does little. The impacts
of technological change on practices like sanctioning need to be understood as part of wider sociotechnical relations underlying evolving ﬁnance/security infrastructures, including in our increasingly digital era.

Escaping yet extending exclusions
Blockchains are distributed ledger technologies enabling the peer-to-peer transaction, veriﬁcation,
and publication of digital objects. Experimentation with blockchain technologies, we argue, is paradoxically enabling both the escape and extension of the very exclusions and power asymmetries
characterizing leading Global North countries’ restrictions of credit ﬂows towards Global South jurisdictions. In this section, we ﬁrst illustrate how the advent and evolution of blockchain technologies since 2009 has provided a range of very real possibilities for evading international sanctions
and undertaking less exclusionary practices. We then trace the still very limited extent to which

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY

529

applications of blockchain technologies in and across jurisdictions subjected to varying types of
sanctions – China, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela – have actually enabled the evasion of such exclusions. Drawing on developments reported in both specialized English-language cryptocurrency and
general ﬁnancial media up until November 2021,6 we contend that the still small scales of blockchain-based sanctions evasion remain signiﬁcant in their highlighting of novel extensions of exclusionary practices. To elaborate this argument, two interrelated variations on the original Bitcoin
blockchain are ﬁrst necessary to distinguish.
A ﬁrst key variation in blockchains is in the ‘types’ of centralization and control maintained over
participation in these digital networks. At one extreme are the original ‘permissionless’ blockchains
open to anyone with Internet access. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most prominent example here.
At the other extreme are ‘permissioned’ blockchains where a gatekeeper(s) control network access.
So-called distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are typically permissioned. Of central importance
to our argument is that the latter type of blockchains are largely being drawn upon by sanctioned
states. This ‘type’ of blockchain is that inherently more exclusionary than the original permissionless form.
The second key element of variation in blockchains enabling extensions of exclusion is in the
varying level of anonymity oﬀered. What analysts refer to as ‘sanctions resistance through cryptocurrency technology’ (Fanusie 2018) is enabled by the anonymity provided by cryptography underpinning blockchains. As the oft-cited author(s) of the technical speciﬁcations for developing Bitcoin
argued, the privacy appeal of cryptocurrency is the ability to ‘see that someone is sending an amount
to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone’ (Nakamoto 2008, p. 6).
To ensure such anonymity is maintained, so-called ‘mixers’ or ‘tumblers,’ like Wasabi, that seek to
prevent individual identity tracking by ‘coinjoining’ transactions together into unpredictable combinations, have emerged (New Money Review Staﬀ 2020). Other cryptocurrencies promise complete anonymity by employing further encryption techniques to fully conceal transaction
histories. Monero, Zcash, and Zerocoin allow actors to ‘convert funds into crypto, anonymize it,
and then cash out.’ Cashing out typically then occurs via ﬁat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges that typically enforce only very basic ‘Know Your Customer’ regulations, although these are growing, as we
detail below. Further possibilities for maintaining anonymity include exchange via darknet markets.
For example, the Russian-language darknet marketplace, Hydra (Allison 2021), as well as the Secret
Network that provides a ‘bridge’ for turning cryptocurrencies developed on the second largest
blockchain, Ethereum, into privacy-enhanced ‘secret tokens’ (Wright 2020b). Table 1 provides a
simpliﬁed overview of key actors and objects whose relations have the potential to form alternative
blockchain-based infrastructural relations.
The novel socio-technical relations enabled by blockchain technologies interact with the set of
relations underpinning the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure in several manners. Most prominently, a host of ﬁnancial actors within sanctioned jurisdictions serve as ‘relations between sociotechnical relations.’ Once wary of cryptocurrencies, banks in both sanctioned and sanctioning
countries have increasingly dealt with these and other applications of blockchain technologies, serving as ‘connecting threads’ between older analog and newer digital infrastructural relations. For
example, banks in the jurisdiction sanctioned by the US for the longest period, Cuba, process

remittances in cryptocurrencies through new ﬁnancial exchanges such as Fusyon, a local exchange
‘distinctively designed’ for the country (Heasman 2019), that provides a ‘lifeline’ for ordinary
Cuban citizens (The Economist 2021).
Similarly, both large and small domestic ﬁrms in sanctioned jurisdictions are enrolling novel
blockchain-based activities into the socio-technical relations underpinning the existing ﬁnance/
security infrastructure. Eﬀorts to harness blockchain to bypass US sanctions have been spurred
by Iranian multinationals, such as the Kish Free Zone organization, which proposed local cryptocurrency mining as a manner of funding car imports (ArzDigital 2020). Smaller ﬁrms in Iran have
accepted cryptocurrency payments, including the 70-year old Persian Shoes that attracted international media attention for accepting payments in Bitcoin (Barrier 2013). The manners in
which attempts at developing new socio-technical relations are enrolled in the existing ﬁnance/
security infrastructure is further exempliﬁed by an Iranian blockchain-based digital currency
backed by gold called PayMon. In 2019, four Iranian banks along with the exchange Iran Fara
Bourse signed up to use the gold-backed cryptocurrency (Financial Tribune 2019). Cryptocurrencies have also been drawn upon to enable international investment in Iran, such as by the Swedish
government, which authorized a local blockchain startup to invest in Iran through Bitcoin (Mizrahi
2017).
Facilitating Bitcoin activities in ways that enable the evasion of international sanctions to a still
limited degree, blockchain-based activities in Iran are signiﬁcant for the ways they reproduce a key
exclusionary element of the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. Private sector activities of Iranian banks and other ﬁrms that had been tacitly supported by the national government began to be
actively controlled by the internal and international activities of the Iranian government. Facing
domestic power outages and seeking to cut down on the high energy consuming production of
cryptocurrencies, the government shut down cryptocurrency mining activities (Thomson 2021).
This left only a few oﬃcially registered Bitcoin production ‘farms,’ many of which are controlled
by Chinese investors (Baydakova 2021a), to generate an estimated $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency used to pay for imports via the Central Bank of Iran (Financial Tribune 2021, Robinson
2021, Sinclair 2021). Internationally, the Iranian government has proposed blockchain-based payments systems based on religious exclusion, for instance with Muslim-majority forming countries
trading in an Islamic cryptocurrency. Other international activity has been based on activities
between Iran and a constrained remit of countries. For example, in 2018 the heads of the Iranian
parliamentary commission on economic aﬀairs and Russian Federation Council Committee on
Economic Policy emphasized the prospect of using cryptocurrencies to bypass US sanctions in
enabling international commodity exchange (Tetkin 2018). This call was echoed in a 2020 statement by Iranian General Saeed Muhammad, that ‘[t]o circumvent sanctions, we must develop solutions such as the exchange of products and the use of cryptocurrencies with our partnerships [in
other countries]’ (Wright 2020a). Which countries are included and excluded from such exchange
was not speciﬁed. The point is that blockchains are not being harnessed in an entirely open and
permissionless manner, but in their permissioned form where certain actors remain excluded. In
this sense, the turn to blockchain technologies is enabling the reproduction, albeit in novel manners, of exclusions upon which the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure is based.
Developments in Venezuela provide another example of how blockchain technologies enable a
thus far limited degree of sanctions evasion, while reproducing the central exclusionary elements of
the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. The Venezuelan government launched a cryptocurrency called the Petro in 2018 as an explicit eﬀort to ‘overcome the [US] ﬁnancial blockade’ (President Maduro cited in McDowell 2020), as well as to ‘advance in issues of monetary sovereignty, to
make ﬁnancial transactions and overcome the ﬁnancial blockade’ (President Maduro cited in Buck
2017). The Petro was developed in a joint venture between Venezuelan and Russian oﬃcials seeking
to erode sanction power and bypass the existing ﬁnancial/security infrastructure (Bull and Rosales
2020). The internationalization of the Petro has been government-led, with oﬃcial oﬀers of discounts on oil purchased in Petro made to countries like India. The Venezuelan government has

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY

531

also sought to attract foreign investors (Zuckerman 2018) from countries like Poland and Norway,
as well as authorized the use of an app to convert Bitcoin to US dollars via partners in countries such
as China (Cointelegraph 2021a) and Russia (Cointelegraph 2021b). Yet, these funds are ultimately
deposited as US dollars in government-controlled bank accounts in those countries (Suberg 2019).
While bypassing key elements of the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure, this is a very limited
extent eﬀort to harness blockchain-based ﬁntech that is also reliant on other elements of the existing
ﬁnance/security infrastructure (e.g. conversion to dollars). It also reproduces the exclusionary
nature of the ﬁnance/security infrastructure through the centralized control of the ‘cryptocurrency’
created and maintained by the Venezuelan government.
Blockchain activities in Russia further exemplify how hitherto limited attempts to harness blockchain technologies to escape sanctions reproduce exclusions of an existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. The Russian government in 2017 had what a former CIA analyst framed as a second
‘Sputnik moment,’ when a domestic scientiﬁc institution successfully tested a blockchain platform
that could withstand hacking from a quantum computer (Fanusie and Zilberman 2017). The aim to
make the country ‘a global leader’ in the technology was tied to making Russia ‘able to withstand
America’s economic sanctions tools in the future’ (Fanusie and Zilberman 2017). Yet, Russian
blockchain-based sanctions evasion has yet to materialize, with attempts do so instead extending
exclusions. The second largest blockchain, Ethereum, underpins a private permissioned intrabank information exchange platform called Masterchain. This closed digital exchange network
was developed by the Russian FinTech Association under the auspices of the Bank of Russia. It
is positioned ‘as a part of the next-generation ﬁnancial infrastructure’ (Naumoﬀ 2016) involving
a few countries selected from the Eurasian Economic Union (Milano 2018). Similarly, a digital
ruble began being developed in 2018 in order to ‘settle accounts with our counterparties all over
the world, with no regard for sanctions’ as economic adviser to President Putin, Sergei Glazyev,
put it (cited in Cappozzalo 2018). A prototype e-ruble is slated for trial between Russian banks
in a ‘mega-project’ (Baydakova 2021b) geared to becoming an ‘integral part of national settlements
by 2023 or 2024’ (Partz 2021a). Granted, the Russian government has proposed several more inclusive international blockchain-based initiatives that would ‘connect some of the most promising
emerging market economies stretching across Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa, and South America,
via blockchain and smart contract technology by using a new multinational cryptocurrency to be
collectively adopted by the BRICS and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) countries (Member
States)’ (Ozelli 2018). Such blockchain ambitions are continually being hinted at by Russian
oﬃcials. For example, a 2021 proposal called for a blockchain-based alternative to the Belgiumbased Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), the technical
messaging system linking together international banks at the center of the ﬁnance/security infrastructure (Nelson 2021). While this particular alternative has yet to materialize, Russia has turned
to another exclusionary set of socio-technical relations by engaging China’s Cross-Border International Payments System (CIPS). The CIPS processed $3.77 trillion in international ﬁnancial
transactions in 2018. While still ‘nowhere close to rivaling SWIFT’ according to a 2019 US Congressional report (Bartholomeuw et al 2019 and more generally Green and Gruin 2021), the CIPS reproduces the ability to exclude entities from payments and ﬁnancial access. Rather than a ‘new’ and
more open socio-technical relation within a ‘alternative’ ﬁnance/security infrastructure, the CIPS
is merely a further attempt to replace one exclusionary set of exclusions with another.
Although not yet subject to the more extensive sanctions that some of its individual members
have faced (Barret et al. 2020), the Chinese government has been ‘prudently enthusiastic’ about
blockchain (Jia and Zhang 2018). The communist government included the technology as a priority
project in its Thirteenth Five-Year National Informatization Plan in 2016 (Gruin 2021). It launched
a Blockchain Services Network (BSN) in March 2020 to coordinates trials of the technology within
China, as well as between ‘portals’ hosted by countries like Turkey and Uzbekistan (Gkritsi 2021).
These experiments have most prominently included a blockchain-based CBDC. Formally called the
digital currency/electric payment (DCEP), the digital yuan has attracted a great deal of attention for

its perceived attempt to enable and enforce the country’s ability to provide and access credit broadly
framed under the notion of ‘ﬁnancial sovereignty’ (Areddy 2021, Tran 2020). A reported $9.5 billion of digital yuan transactions were conducted as of October 2021 by 140 million users, including
banks and citizens in several large cities, as well as the international ﬁnancial centers of Shanghai
and Hong Kong. The digital yuan is enabled by the technology of several large technology ﬁrms and
banks, yet remains centrally controlled by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and its concern with
enforcing ‘capital controls and border monetary policy’ (Avan-Nomayo 2021, Fanusie and Logan
2019, Reuters 2021). In fulﬁlling a broader stated aim at ‘optimizing the country’s cryptocurrency
infrastructure’ (Day 2020), the internationalization of digital yuan is at once the clearest attempt to
develop a new ﬁnance/security infrastructure and of reproducing the exclusionary nature of the
existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. In 2021, the PBoC revealed plans for a ‘universal digital
payments network’ (UDPN) for enabling ‘international transfers and payments with and between
central bank digital currencies’ (Phillips 2021). Yet, what became the Multiple Central Bank Digital
Currency Bridge (m-CBDC) project has only linked Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab
Emirates in a wider plan to establish the DCEP as the pan-Asian payments infrastructure underpinning trade across the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative (Crawley 2021). Beyond Asia, meanwhile, adoption of the digital yuan in Africa is being enabled through the introduction of
smartphones with hardware wallets, facilitating use of the DCEP and which build on Huawei
and other Chinese technology ﬁrms’ dominant position in mobile handset production and networks across the continent (Kimani 2021). There are plans to ensure that the digital yuan is only
accessed through ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation technology (Pan 2021b), reﬂecting the persistent ability
to exclude access to the CBDC, for instance, to dissidents. Once again, attempts to escape international sanctions through blockchain technology reproduce in novel digital neo-colonial form
the exclusions characterizing the existing ﬁnance/security system.
In sum, despite considerable potential, emerging blockchain ﬁntech applications in and across
sanctioned countries have thus far led only to small scale sanctions evasion that we argue is
more signiﬁcant to the extent that these eﬀorts extend exclusions characterizing existing infrastructural relations. At times hyperbolic claims about blockchain applications facilitating sanctions evasion (e.g. Barone and Masciandaro 2019, Teichmann and Falker 2021) point to both the cases that
we noted here, as well as wider illicit activities being facilitated through applications of these technologies. Most prominent here is blockchain-based money laundering (Campbell-Verduyn 2018)
and international attention-grabbing revelations, such as a $250 million scheme set up by North
Korea-linked actors in 2018 (Zagaris and Bannister 2020). These wider activities and still-limited
attempts at evading signiﬁcant international sanctions provide possibilities for enrolling a growing
a range of African blockchain-based activities into persistently exclusionary infrastructural
relations. Nigeria, where cryptocurrency activity has boomed despite an oﬃcial ban (Baydakova
2021c), for example, announced in 2018 a yet-to-materialize plan to establish a ‘Free Crypto Currency Economic Zone’ with Russia.7 Nigerian businesses have engaged in small scale cryptocurrency-denominated trade with China (Hertig 2020). Both Chinese and Russian ﬁrms have
further facilitated the adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology by mining companies
operating in the Democratic People’s Republic of Congo and the creation of digital platforms such
as ModulTrade in Burkina Faso (Phillips 2018). Eﬀorts to circumvent sanctions by Venezuela,
meanwhile, have implicated countries like Egypt (Blockchain Tech 2018).
Ostensibly ‘alternative’ blockchain-based activities emerging in and across sanctioned countries,
which we summarize in Table 2, reproduce, albeit in diﬀerent manners, the exclusionary relations
characterizing the very ﬁnance/security infrastructure they seek to counter. What still small-scale
blockchain-enabled eﬀorts to escape international sanctions are more importantly contributing
to, then, is a furthering of the historical exclusions characterizing the coloniality of the existing
ﬁnance/security infrastructure. While not necessarily neo-colonial, emerging blockchain-based
eﬀorts appear unlikely to enhance African decolonial ambitions. Varying in the extent to which
they are being ‘enrolled’ into ‘alternative’ socio-technical relations, the African ‘ﬁntech frontier’

risks extending exclusions characterizing a digitizing yet still neo-colonial ﬁnance/security infrastructure. This is most prominently illustrated by the growing blockchain-based infrastructural relations
between Chinese and African ﬁrms in settling a still very small degree of international trade in cryptocurrency (Hertig 2020). While still limited in scope, these developments point to how African
ﬁntech ambitions are becoming enrolled into persistently exclusionary socio-technical relations.
They are also signiﬁcant in the extent to which have sparked wider concern in American national
security think tanks about ‘how China seized the initiative on blockchain’ (Murray 2021). As the
next section proceeds to detail, emerging blockchain-based attempts to escape sanctions are not
only reproducing exclusions themselves, but are spurring further eﬀorts to draw on this technology
in extending exclusionary practices underpinning the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure.

Enforcing and extending exclusions
Finance/security infrastructures, like all infrastructures, are not static. The open, permanent ledger
of transactions originally provided by blockchain technologies oﬀer means not merely for evading
international sanctions, but also of enforcing them. These twin possibilities are materializing handin-hand. Eﬀorts to escape sanctions through blockchain have instigated attempts at enforcing these
exclusions in oﬃcial experimentation with the technology across the Global North. While relatively
small-scale, blockchain-based sanctions evasion has instigated growing uses of this very same set of
evolving technologies for extending the exclusions at the core of the existing neo-colonial ﬁnance/
security infrastructure. The manners in which blockchains are underpinning exclusionary sociotechnical relations in the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure is most prominently reﬂected by
the development and expansion of an international blockchain intelligence industry.
A ﬂurry of ‘data analytics’ ﬁrms have arisen since 2015 that harness blockchains to develop
proﬁles of illicit cryptocurrency transactions and users. These proﬁles and tracking services are
sold to sanctioning governments, intergovernmental police organizations, and multinational
ﬁrms, including most of the large international banks. The blockchain intelligence industry consists
of both small start-ups (Table 3), as well as larger and longer existing multinational ﬁrms (Table 4)
whose activities and personnel are tightly interlinked with its governmental, corporate, and international security services clients. Like other areas of ﬁnancial governance, there is considerable
overlap as well as a ‘revolving door’ between the blockchain intelligence industry and sanctioning
governments. This overlap was revealed in a 2019 report provided to the U.S. Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network8 and other ﬁnancial regulators that a Cryptocurrency Indicators of Suspicion

detailed dozens of illicit patterns of transactions on blockchain along with a ‘road map’ for tackling
them (del Castillo 2019). Another illustration of the overlapping relations between regulators and
industry personnel was the April 2021 appointment to Acting Director of the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury (FinCen) of the previous
Chief Technical Counsel of Chainalysis (FinCEN 2021). That same month, new international sanctions were imposed by the US Treasury on a number of Bitcoin, Zcash and other cryptocurrency
addresses used by Pakistan-based SecondEye Solution to be paid around $2.5million in some
27,000 digital currency transactions in order to create false identities for members of a Russian
organization accused of US election interference and other cyberattacks (De 2021). The 2021 FinCen measures built on a growing litany of activities by other oﬃces at the US Treasury (see Rella
2020). In particular, the Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in February 2021 ﬁned Atlantabased Bitpay more than half a million US dollars for facilitating over 2,100 transactions with individuals in sanctioned countries that included Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and Sudan (U.S. Department of Treasury 2021). OFAC had earlier, in 2018, sanctioned two Iranian individuals for their
alleged involvement in the Bitcoin ransomware scheme SamSam. This was the ﬁrst time that
OFAC publicly attributed cryptocurrency addresses to designated individuals for what the U.S.
Department of Treasury (2018) described as helping ‘exchange digital currency ransom payments
into Iranian rial on behalf of Iranian malicious cyber actors involved with the SamSam ransomware
scheme that targeted over 200 known victims’ (Young 2021b).
These measures were seen by many in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries as a harbinger of further oﬃcial actions. The OFAC’s Oﬃce of Global Targeting in 2021 indicated that it would

enhance its use of blockchain surveillance tools oﬀered by Chainalysis (Singer 2021, Young 2021b).
A few months later OFAC announced sanctions on cryptocurrency exchange Suex following investigations by Chainanlysis (2021) that the ﬁrm’s Moscow and St. Petersburg branches had facilitated
the transfer of $160 million in Bitcoin from ransomware payments and darknet markets. In October
2021, OFAC (2021) published guidance declaring that its sanctions ‘apply equally to transactions
involving virtual currencies and those involving traditional ﬁat currencies.’
These developments illustrate how relations of exclusion at the heart of existing ﬁnance/security
infrastructure are extended via blockchains to counter the very attempts at harnessing this set of
technologies to evade international sanctions. Growing blockchain-based eﬀorts across the Global
South are instigating the expansion of restrictions by leading actors in the Global North through
blockchain applications. Both the US9 and the EU10 are contemplating the development of their
own Central Bank-backed Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are being tested by the central banks
of central banks, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) (Tassev 2021). Based, to varying
extents, on permissioned blockchains, CBDCs seek, amongst other objectives, to extend realtime overview of transactions that can more clearly highlight transactions that may be in breach
of international sanctions. Even the SWIFT, which has long been reliant on legacy technologies
from the 1970s,11 has experimented with permissioned blockchains (Zmudzinski 2019, De Meijer
2017) and in early 2021 initiated a joint venture with the PBOC (Pan 2021a). The double edged
sword of technology entails opportunities for both escaping and enforcing sanctions, as the US
and European countries turn to the very CBDCs being embraced in China, Russia, and Venezuela
and sanctioned jurisdictions (Meredith 2021).
Oﬃcial experimentation across the Global North with less inclusive ‘permissioned’ forms of
blockchain technologies and emerging within a growing intelligence industry are extending ‘global
banking surveillance’ as part of a widening formal, legal, and regulatory ‘compliance infrastructure’
(Mallard and Hanson 2021). Exclusionary practices have included targeted prohibitions of speciﬁc
activities enabled by blockchain technology, such as bans of Iranian-based cryptocurrency exchange
customers by countries like Finland. Further restrictive measures on uses of the technology were
imposed by the Council of the European Union in 2020 on Chinese and Russian individuals allegedly involved in cyber-attacks that had demanded cryptocurrencies for ransoms. Restrictions were
also undertaken in the US’s 2018 Blocking Iran Illicit Finance Act, which expanded sanctions to any
ﬁnancial institution engaging in the sale, supply, holding, or transfer of the Iranian digital currency
(Alexandre 2018). A March 2018 executive order also speciﬁcally banned U.S. citizens from buying
the Petro, an order that led exchanges around the world, such as Hong-Kong based Bitﬁnex, to
delist the Venezuelan cryptocurrency.12 These sanctions enforcement actions emanate primarily,
albeit not solely, from the hegemonic country currently most capable of extending exclusions to
and through activities enabled by blockchain technologies. Yet, the US is not necessarily the only
country willing to extend exclusions through blockchain. As noted, European countries are exploring both the inclusive and exclusive possibilities of CBDCS. Sanctioned countries themselves, moreover, are harnessing cryptocurrency and blockchains in ways that are enabling new exclusions while
extending existing ones.
The sum of these emerging trends does not entirely curtail possibilities for actualizing decolonial
ambitions through ﬁnancial technologies. The decolonial possibilities oﬀered by blockchain technologies in Africa and across the Global South instead need to be understood in parallel with extensions of exclusionary practices at the heart of the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. As we
contemplate in the conclusion section, blockchains are double edged swords whose integration
into existing socio-technical relations does not follow a predetermined path. It remains possible
that African blockchain-based experiments enact more inclusive socio-technical relations that
can provide more genuine alternatives to the exclusionary existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure.
Yet, without understanding how current blockchain-based activities help to enforce sanctions and
extend exclusions, it remains diﬃcult to conceive of alternative ﬁnance/security infrastructures that
are more open and less based on exclusions.

Conclusions
This article has sought to nuance growing hype around blockchain as a (de)colonial technology. We
argued that blockchain-based ﬁntech are facilitating, rather than displacing, exclusionary practices
of sanctioning underpinning the existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure. Experimentation with
blockchain technologies across the African continent risks being enrolled socio-technical relations
that, as we have shown, are persistently exclusionary. Instead of displacing or ‘disrupting’ sanctions
(Smith 2019), blockchains are enabling both new and old sanctioners with exclusionary possibilities. For blockchain, or any ‘ﬁntech’ for that matter, to contribute genuine decolonial possibilities to
an alternative ﬁnance/security infrastructure, sanctioning and other exclusionary practices of digital
technology must be confronted.
We situated evolving applications of this set of ﬁntechs within the wider, geographically dispersed
attempts to both enforce and evade sanctions. The very socio-technical relations enabling sanctions
evasions, we argued, extend exclusions themselves and instigate relations between a blockchain intelligence industry and governments enforcing the exclusions central to an existing ﬁnance/security
infrastructure. Although they may incorporate diﬀerent actors and technologies, the novelty of
these socio-technical relations does not preclude the exclusions that the existing ﬁnance/security
infrastructure enables. Like all technologies, blockchains need to be understood within human
practices and their relations with technical objects as double-edged swords that cut multiple ways.
In the case of sanctions, both the evasion and enforcement of this set of exclusionary practices are
being enabled in socio-technical relations that are not creating a new or alternative ﬁnance/security
infrastructure. As a set of technologies that was originally designed to challenge existing ﬁnance/
security infrastructures, blockchain is paradoxically reinforcing existing relations. Yet, blockchain
applications do not entirely foreclose possibilities for decolonial relations. There remain eﬀorts in
and between BRICS countries,13 as well as the Russian and Chinese governments via the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization,14 that warn against suggestions that ‘there is no alternative’ (Dörry
et al 2018) to an exclusionary neo-colonial existing ﬁnance/security infrastructure.
Future cultural economy research should strive to further situate decolonial ambitions in wider
international eﬀorts to alter, change, or undermine ﬁnance/security infrastructures. Interdisciplinary
research can help investigate these possibilities in considering how open source technologies those
who code is available to anyone with a computer and internet connection — is equally used by enforcers of existing socio-technical relations and by those seeking to enable ‘alternative’ ﬁnance/security
infrastructure. How earlier technologies not only enabled the development of the existing ﬁnance/
security infrastructures (de Goede 2020), but also undermined and limited previous attempts to create
alternative sets of socio-technical relations, should be explored. Future studies could, for example,
draw out possible historical comparisons with the current trajectories of technological change and
exclusionary nature of ﬁnance/security infrastructures. Studies could also trace on-going technology-enabled attempts in and across African countries, from the Central African Republic to Zimbabwe, to evade and emerge from sanctions, as well as the roles of foreign actors in attempts like
those of the Swiss-based Bitcoin Association to promote its Blockchain for Government in Sudan
(Bitcoin Association 2021). Our hope is that this contribution provides an impetus for further
scholarly exploration of the decolonial possibilities of blockchain and other ﬁntechs situated with
infrastructural relations within and between the Global North and Global South.

Sanctions imposed by the UN implicate Global South countries, yet are typically though not always led by
‘Global North’ countries.

2012 after $24m transactions processed on behalf of Iranian parties and a total of $109m to Burma, Sudan and
Libya between 2001 and 2007 (Mallard et al. 2020, p. 131)
