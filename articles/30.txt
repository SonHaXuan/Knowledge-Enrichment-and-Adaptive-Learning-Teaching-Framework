CHINA’S APPROACH TO CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL
CURRENCY: SELECTIVELY RESHAPING INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL ORDER?

HENG WANG*

ABSTRACT
China is likely to be the first major economy to issue central bank
digital currency (CBDC), the digital version of sovereign currency.
China’s CBDC is also known as e-CNY, DC/EP, or digital yuan. ECNY has the potential to profoundly affect the international
financial system and order. This article explores the following
crucial issues from an international perspective: what are the core
features of e-CNY? What is China’s approach to CBDC? What is the
long-term sustainability of China’s CBDC approach?
This article argues that the role of the state, the potential crossborder use of e-CNY, and China’s proactiveness in international
governance are the core features of China’s CBDC. These features

contribute to China’s CBDC approach, a possible selective reshaping
of international financial order. The article adopts a multifactor
analytical framework which explores major economic, political
economy, legal and regulatory factors affecting the sustainability of
China’s CBDC approach. This framework seeks to promote a
holistic understanding of e-CNY’s evolution and its profound
implications for international economic governance.

1. INTRODUCTION
Central bank digital currency (CBDC), also called sovereign
digital currency (SDC), is the digital version of sovereign currency
issued by an economy’s monetary authority. 1 An increasing
number of central banks are exploring CBDC, including the Bank of
England and the Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden.2 The digital
dollar has also been considered, with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
design a CBDC prototype.3 At least thirteen states (e.g., Sweden,
and South Korea) are testing CBDC pilots,4 with some central banks
like the European Central Bank considering such tests. 5 The
Bahamas, Eastern Caribbean, and Nigeria have rolled out CBDC.6
CBDC involves “the algorithmic hand” beside the “invisible”
hand (the market) and the “visible” hand (government).7 It is likely
to be a critical part of the digital economy, accelerated by the
epidemic, 8 while carrying both “policy and legal implications.” 9

China's Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency

81

CBDC raises many issues including digital payment ecology,
financial inclusion, data protection and sovereignty, compliance,
financial risks, and governance models.10
China is expected to be the first major economy to launch
CBDC. 11 China’s CBDC was previously known as the Digital
Currency/Electronic Payment (DC/EP or DCEP), 12 and is also
variously called e-CNY, digital yuan, eCNY, or e-RMB. The People’s
Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, started CBDC research
in 201413 and issued a white paper on e-CNY (White Paper) in 2021,
with no timetable for the final launch of e-CNY.14 For e-CNY, “toplevel design, function development, and system testing has been
basically completed.”15 E-CNY pilots have been conducted in ten
regions (e.g., Shenzhen)16 and the Beijing Winter Olympics.17
It is probable that E-CNY will lead to an economic ecosystem
(e.g., financial instruments denominated in e-CNY) 18 that is more

than just currency or a new “currency infrastructure.” 19 Digital
yuan is likely to develop an ecosystem that interacts with
established and emerging payment systems, 20 with such systems
ranging from payment to e-commerce involving, among others, big
tech companies, banking institutions and individuals. 21
International consumer brands, including McDonald’s, Starbucks,
and Subway have been involved in the e-CNY trial.22 Accordingly,
e-CNY is “likely to become an important feature of China’s digital
economy and financial system.”23
China’s CBDC is among potential CBDCs that could have real
global implications. 24 For CBDC, it has been suggested that
“[w]hatever the Chinese do will affect other national economies.”25
It is expected that China’s CBDC may be “the powerful disruption
that kickstarts a move from the extensive SDC-related research and
piloting we have seen in Canada, England, and elsewhere, to
multiple instances of SDC issuance, particularly by major

economies.” 26 More generally, CBDCs will likely affect the
development and use of each other. For instance, at the time of this
writing, the Federal Reserve is seeking comments on CBDC,
including those on how the decisions to issue CBDC should be
influenced by other large economies’ decisions around CBDC.27
This article explores China’s approach to CBDC, particularly
from an international perspective. The international dimension and
impact of China’s CBDC will be highlighted since it carries profound
implications for the future of the international economy, while it has
received scant attention in current research. This article will first
analyse the key aspects of e-CNY (chapter II), and then its core
features (chapter III). For its core features, e-CNY is characterised
internally by the strengthened role of the state, and externally by
possible cross-border use of e-CNY, and China’s proactiveness in
international governance regarding CBDC. I argue that these
features contribute to China’s CBDC approach of selective
reshaping of international economic governance (chapter IV). The
article further explores a multifactor framework, engaging with
economic, political economy, and legal and regulatory factors, to
analyse the sustainability of China’s CBDC approach (chapter V).
Chapter VI concludes the paper with a short summary and
reflection.
Some carve-outs are rather useful here. This article is based on
publicly available materials and does not claim to contain all
possible information on CBDC. For CBDC-related research,
“caution is warranted in any comparative analysis about a subject in
which the public-facing statements and trials are only the tip of the
iceberg in comparison to the research, knowledge, and trials that are
internal to each central bank and government.”28 Also, of note, this
article does not focus on the merits of CBDC, which demand a
separate analysis.

2. WHAT IS CHINA’S CBDC?
China’s CBDC is “the digital version of fiat currency issued by
the PBOC.”29 Through account-based interfaces, e-CNY is, at the
time of this writing, available to both the public and foreign visitors
to China.30 E-CNY’s functions include “exchange and circulation
management, interoperability and [a] wallet ecosystem.”31 Several
major aspects of e-CNY will be discussed below.
2.1. Two-Tier Operational System
China’s CBDC features a hybrid operational system with two
layers dealing with issuance and circulation.32 Within the first layer
(the distribution layer), the central bank distributes CBDC to
individual banks or payment platforms that then circulate CBDC to
users in the second layer.33
The structure of e-CNY is illustrated in the figure below.

Figure 1: The structure of e-CNY34

In the first layer, the PBOC issues e-CNY to second-tier
institutions (currently including six major state-owned banks and
two internet banks), also called authorized operators, operating
institutions, operating agencies or tier 2 institutions.35 Second-tier
institutions circulate the e-CNY to retail market participants,
including the public.36 The list of second-tier institutions is likely to
grow. They will lead the CBDC exchange services37 (exchanging e-

CNY into traditional CNY for the public38) and circulation services.39
Second-tier institutions are also e-CNY wallet providers.40 A user
needs to go to one of these second-tier institutions to open an e-CNY
wallet, 41 which usually involves an e-CNY wallet app. Three
telecommunication operators are also working with major stateowned banks to form joint project teams to participate in e-CNY
research and development.42
Other banks and service providers may be “tier 2.5 institutions”
(also known as “related commercial institutions”) that supply
payment and other services to e-CNY holders, but cannot provide eCNY exchange services. 43 These institutions appear to include a
number of other banks and third-party payment service providers.44
Tier 2.5 institutions could also be regarded as secondary issuers.45

They will join the e-CNY system to provide “e-CNY circulation
services and retail management, including innovation on payment
product design, system development, scenario expansion,
marketing, business processing as well as operation and
maintenance.”46 Tier 2.5 institutions are expected to cooperate with
one or more of authorized operators.47 After the e-CNY wallet is
opened, the user can then access a variety of services provided by
both the issuing bank (one of the tier 2 institutions) and tier 2.5
institutions.48 For instance, ride hailing service, Didi Chuxing, and
food delivery business, Meituan Dianping, are involved in the
CBDC trial.49 Tiers 2 and 2.5 institutions are e-CNY intermediaries,
many of which have been involved in the development of the e-CNY
ecosystem’s “payments solutions and functions.”50
End users include businesses and the public.51 Individual endusers will not be charged by commercial banks for the e-CNY
exchange and circulation services.52 It seems that the issue of fees

collected by tiers 2 and 2.5 institutions on businesses will be decided
by the market.53
2.2. Loosely Coupled with Bank Accounts
A major feature of e-CNY is its loose coupling with bank
accounts. 54 E-CNY is “a value-based, quasi-account-based and
account-based hybrid payment instrument,” with “loosely-coupled
account linkage.” 55 Said differently, e-CNY is “based on broad
accounts, loosely coupled with bank accounts.”56 However, there
seems to be limited elaboration further on what “loosely-coupled
account linkage” means. 57 E-CNY wallets may be used without
opening or linking to a bank account in some circumstances that
provide rather basic functions:58 unbanked individuals may access
“basic financial services provided via [an] e-CNY wallet,” and
foreign visitors may open an e-CNY wallet “to meet daily payment
needs without opening a domestic bank account.”59
2.3. Managed Anonymity
Managed anonymity is a major feature of e-CNY.60 According
to the PBOC, managed anonymity means that the CBDC system
“does not provide information to third parties or other government
agencies unless stipulated otherwise in laws and regulations.”61 For

a digital wallet app, where the user’s identity has been verified, the
PBOC will know the user’s identity. 62 In contrast, transactions
conducted through the e-CNY wallet app will only transmit the
wallet ID, with neither the transaction parties nor the sub-wallet
account bank knowing the user’s identity.63 This means that users
may be able to “hide their identity from counterparties,” making it
“more difficult for online platforms to collect user information.”64
The regulation in this regard is yet to be seen. According to the
Law of the People’s Republic of China on People’s Bank of China
(“PBOC”) (Amendment Draft for Consultation) of 2020 (the “2020
Amendment Draft”), the PBOC and its branches may ask the
regulated entity to provide data and information as required by
regulation.65 The PBOC should, under the 2020 Amendment Draft,
establish a regulatory information sharing mechanism with the
member institutions of the Financial Stability and Development
Committee under the State Council. 66 However, it is not clear
whether and how evolving rules on the sharing of government
information among government agencies (such as the Notice of the
State Council on Issuing the Interim Measures for the
Administration of Sharing of Government Information Resources)
will apply to e-CNY.67

3. CORE FEATURES OF E-CNY
China’s CBDC approach can be understood in terms of three
core features of the e-CNY: the role of the state (including the
prohibition of cryptocurrencies), the possible cross-border use of eCNY, and China’s proactive efforts in international governance
concerning CBDC.
3.1. The Role of the State
E-CNY is a state-led initiative, echoing the development of
digital currency which is indicated in China’s fourteenth Five-Year
Plan and is regarded as part of structural reforms on the financial
supply side. 68 The government is proactive in various aspects of
CBDC, including local governments reportedly giving away
funding to residents to trial the e-CNY.69 Major factors in selecting
e-CNY pilot areas include both national and regional development
strategies.70
The legal concept of money is based on the state’s power to
regulate the monetary system. 71 CBDC concerns the “very
fundamental relationship between money, the State, and the law.”72
This part focuses on the state’s role in CBDC-related regulation:
China’s prohibition of cryptocurrencies and the centralized
governance model regarding e-CNY.

China's Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency

3.1.1. The Prohibition on Cryptocurrencies
China’s CBDC approach should be viewed through a functional
lens. Its regulation of cryptocurrencies and CBDC is like two sides
of a coin, cryptocurrencies being regarded as the opposite of
CBDC. 73 Cryptocurrencies are typically understood to include
stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin). 74
Cryptocurrencies consist of “open” cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin
and Ether) that “operate outside the jurisdiction and direct control
of the state or any single entity,” and “corporate or consortiummanaged digital currencies.” 75 E-CNY is managed by the PBOC,
contrasted with most cryptocurrencies that aim to decentralize
power traditionally reserved by the state.76 To some extent, e-CNY
is driven by the response to cryptocurrencies and, relatedly, the risk
of capital flight.77
China does not permit the parallel development of decentralized
cryptocurrencies and CBDC. In the 2020 Amendment Draft, the
PBOC proposed to confirm e-CNY’s legal tender status as the digital
form of RMB. 78 The 2020 Amendment Draft also forbids and

The crackdown on cryptocurrencies is a distinctive aspect of
China’s CBDC approach, differing from many economies in which
CBDC and cryptocurrencies could co-exist. This seems to reflect
“China’s ‘state-centric’ monetary system.”81
3.1.2. A Centralized Governance Model
E-CNY is managed under a centralized model, 82 and it is
observed to be “hypercentralized.” 83 According to a then PBOC
deputy governor, central governance of e-CNY is meaningful for
several reasons: (i) maintaining the role of fiat currency and the
authority to issue currency; (ii) enhancing efficiency in payment
systems and improving monetary policy transmission (e.g., e-CNY’s

“settled upon payment” to speed up currency circulation); and (iii)
ensuring financial stability (e.g., the use of big data and AI to inhibit
illicit activities). 84 CBDC would strengthen the role of the state,
which includes related agencies (e.g., taxation authorities), and
provide the PBOC with “tight centralized control over digital
money.”85 The analysis here focuses on the PBOC, which issues eCNY and manages the whole CBDC life cycle through the e-CNY
systems’ operation, regulation, infrastructure and data.86
First, the PBOC is at the center of the operation of the e-CNY
system, including taking care of CBDC issuance and disposal.87 To
illustrate, there is the PBOC’s central ledger,88 the “core” of e-CNY.89
E-CNY wallets also provide a prime example. The use of e-CNY
usually requires downloading the PBOC’s e-CNY app that is the
core node of the e-CNY system, and the central bank is the core entry
and clearing center for e-CNY. 90 Moreover, all cross-institutional
transactions need to go through the PBOC for the value transfer to
occur.91
Second, the PBOC plays the leading role in regulation and
setting rules and standards relating to CBDC. The 2020 Amendment
Draft provides the central bank with powers spanning across the
planning, organization and supervision of the payment system,

along with responsibility for the cybersecurity of e-CNY. 92 The
PBOC also supervises CBDC exchange and circulation93 (including
anti-money laundering (“AML”) regulation) 94 and regulates
authorised operators and other commercial institutions. 95
According to a then PBOC deputy governor, the centralized
governance of e-CNY requires the setting of standards (i.e.,
technical, business, security and operational standards). 96 The
PBOC is responsible for setting rules for e-CNY wallets and
managing e-CNY wallet ecosystem. 97 Commercial banks and
licensed non-bank payment institutions must obtain the PBOC’s
recognition and support, and must meet compliance and regulatory
requirements (e.g., AML, risk management) to take part in China’s
CBDC payment system. 98
Authorized operators providing
exchange services operate under the “quota management of the
PBOC.”99
Third, the PBOC is at the center of the system’s infrastructure.
Centralized governance of e-CNY involves the development of eCNY infrastructure (including the connection of different operating
institutions). 100 The PBOC is responsible for “inter-institution
connect.”101 Regarding the monitoring of e-CNY transactions, the
PBOC is expected to establish three centers for authentication,
registration, and big data analysis respectively.102
Fourth, the PBOC plays a central role in many other aspects such
as technology and data. The PBOC is observed to be “rel[ying] to a
greater extent on internal resources [in acquiring technology] and

has different contractors for different areas as necessary,” which
provides “more control over the development process.”103
Centralized governance of e-CNY also involves the management
of e-CNY information. 104 E-CNY will likely “revolutionize” the
regulator’s capacity to “scrutinize the nation’s payment and
financial system” with additional powers to track how money is
used.105 The central bank could have access to CBDC transaction
data and data regarding e-CNY digital wallets, but authorized
operators will no longer be able to access all transaction information
as was the case before the rolling out of e-CNY; if e-CNY wallets of
the payer and payee are opened at different authorized operators,
each authorized operator would not have all the information of both
parties to the transaction, reflecting e-CNY’s managed anonymity
feature.106 Under the loose coupling of accounts, CBDC operating
agencies will “submit transaction data to the central bank via
asynchronous transmission,” enabling the central bank to “keep
track of necessary data.” 107 Conversely, the managed anonymity
feature of e-CNY will hinder an online platform’s collection of user
information.108 E-CNY’s “touch and touch” function, enabling two
end users to touch their mobile devices to conduct a fund transfer,
“leav[es] no payment record with a third party or the banking
system.” 109 Managed anonymity features aside, e-CNY helps the
state secure a central role in the financial system and fintech
industry (including a huge e-payments market).110

3.2. The Possible Cross-Border Use of e-CNY
The PBOC has emphasized “the importance of exploring crossborder payments with CBDC,” 111 likely involving retail and
wholesale use cases outside Mainland China. For instance, Hong
Kong’s forthcoming pilot scheme for e-CNY use will involve retail
use in some contexts like shopping and dining for certain individual
users in Hong Kong and Hongkongers living in the Greater Bay
Area.112 The PBOC is also involved in the Multiple CBDC Bridge
project (mCBDC Bridge, or mBridge), a wholesale CBDC “cocreation” project that explores the capabilities of DLT and that
focuses on cross-currency cross-border payments. 113 Here, the
PBOC has collaborated with regulators in Hong Kong, Thailand and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as well as the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) under this mCBDC Bridge.114
The possible cross-border use of e-CNY is explored through new
and existing mechanisms, multi-level efforts, and the technology
and networks that China is involved in. The improvement of
international payment is one of the three objectives of China’s
CBDC. 115 The PBOC believes that China’s CBDC is “technically
ready for cross-border use,” 116 and the bank is to beginning to
explore cross-border use, including “pilot cross-border payment
programs.”117 E-CNY may also gain international use due to, inter
alia, network effects and common infrastructure and standards.118 If
everything goes smoothly, e-CNY could be used in international

exchange payments (as explored in the m-CBDC Bridge),
remittance, 121 and possibly the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
projects (e.g., RMB loans and investments).122 E-CNY will likely be
first used in business-to-consumer (B2C) and then in cross-border
flows in the medium-to-long term.123
3.2.1. The Use of Existing and New Mechanisms
China appears to utilize existing and new mechanisms to
explore the cross-border use of CBDC. 124 Its efforts often focus on
finance and technology and the development of infrastructure.
In relation to finance, China engages with existing financial
systems including SWIFT, the global financial messaging system.125
China established a joint venture with SWIFT in 2021, which is
regarded as part of the efforts to explore the international use of
China’s CBDC and propel RMB internationalization. 126 For
instance, the joint venture will establish a localized data warehouse

to “monitor and analyze cross-border payment messaging.” 127
Meanwhile, China’s CBDC is observed to reflect greater efforts to
promote an “independent payments system based on its CrossBorder Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS).”128
Concerning technology, new mechanisms may be adopted to
promote the CBDC. Blockchain provides a good example. The
PBOC Digital Currency Institute (DCI) is developing a trade finance
blockchain platform.129 China’s government-backed initiative, the
Blockchain Service Network (hereinafter “BSN”), may also help
promote the use of CBDC.130 Aiming to reduce the costs of using
blockchains by individuals and SMEs, the BSN reportedly plans to
develop an international network to support future CBDCs. 131
China also launched the Global Initiative on Data Security in 2020.132

3.2.2. Multi-Level Efforts
China is exploring the cross-border use of CBDC at different
levels. E-CNY trials in China are regarded by the PBOC as a basis
for the pilot cross-border payment programs related to e-CNY. 133
For example, China’s Xiongan New Area is planning for the crossborder use of digital yuan. 134 The 2022 Winter Olympics also
involved a CBDC pilot.135 Business and trade use cases may also see
increased testing.136
Outside Mainland China, the DCI has signed a memorandum
with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, with e-CNY cross-border
payment technical testing having been conducted.137 At the time of
writing, Hong Kong reportedly plans to conduct e-CNY pilots with
certain restaurants and shops. 138 It seems that the Macau
government will also work with the PBOC to “study the feasibility
of issuing a digital currency.”139 As an example of bilateral efforts,
the possibility of Chinese tourists using China’s CBDC abroad is
reportedly being explored by China and Singapore.140
In addition, the PBOC has collaborated with regulators in Hong
Kong, Thailand, and the UAE as well as the BIS under the mCBDC
Bridge.141 Multiple CBDC systems are being explored through the
mCBDC Bridge that involves a prototype “to support real-time
cross-border foreign exchange PvP [payment versus payment]
transactions in multiple jurisdictions, operating 24/7.”142 The PBOC

3.2.3. Taking Advantage of Technology and Network
New technology will help e-CNY lower costs and improve
convenience and efficiency in commerce. CBDC frameworks may
be leveraged to enhance international payments (e.g., the conversion
of CBDCs)144 and lower costs (such as e-CNY lowering transaction
costs for international users compared with cash). 145 E-CNY
seemingly aims to further the efficiency and reduce the cost of interbank settlements, which is linked with the international acceptance
of e-CNY.146 The m-CBDC Bridge is exploring the use of CBDC and
blockchain technology in cross-border foreign currency payments,
aiming to make such payments simpler and less expensive.147 CBDC
may also streamline communication processes. Many problems
with international fund transfers are attributable to the
“communication hops” and numerous updates to ledgers across
many intermediaries. 148 CBDCs may enable countries to transact
separately, which “would lower demand for correspondent banking
services and SWIFT international financial messaging and payment
systems.” 149 Moreover, CBDC may reduce the cost of liquidity
management. 150 For cross-border payment through traditional
money, liquidity management is usually done through prefunding

(i.e., keeping balances in relevant accounts), which is costly.151 That
said, cross-border use of e-CNY faces similar challenges to existing
currencies, such as capital controls.152
China will likely take advantage of its network, such as its trade
and payment networks, to promote CBDC.153 E-CNY may continue
China’s use of its leading role in trade to increase demand for RMB
in trade settlement.154 For instance, cross-border use of e-CNY and
e-HKD could be impactful given the large volume of trade between
Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China. 155 Notably, BRI-related
projects and transactions also promote RMB settlement. 156 If
everything goes smoothly, CBDC might be used in BRI projects (e.g.,
RMB loans and investments). 157 With many BRI projects being
implemented by Chinese businesses, “the contractor payments
could be made using the digital yuan, without routing the money
through foreign governments.”158 China could “increasingly bill in
yuan” given its large-volume trade with Asian and African states,159

and e-CNY may be promoted in a network of international trade
built through the BRI.160
China’s outbound tourism could also serve to promote the
international use of e-CNY. 161 According to an investment
strategist, it is even possible that a “Chinese tourist [could] settle
with e-RMB if the oversea [sic] hotel has an e-RMB machine installed
that transacts directly through the PBOC settlement system.”162
China could also distribute e-CNY through pre-existing
payment platforms (e.g., Alipay wallets) and ride on current
acceptance infrastructure and networks to improve the scalability of
e-CNY. 163 E-CNY could be used through Alipay, 164 and is also
connected with China UnionPay Merchant Services, which is
affiliated with China UnionPay (a leading payment provider). 165
One may argue that, theoretically, e-CNY could be used overseas
through Chinese payment apps and services.166

of a community of common destiny in cyberspace” in China’s recent
Five-Year Plan, there is a plan for China to “actively participate” in
rulemaking across “data security, digital currency, digital tax, and
standards on digital technology.”167
China appears to play an active role in formulating emerging
standards related to CBDC at various venues and organizations.
China has called for the G20 to address the development of CBDC
standards and principles while confronting the various risks and
challenges. 168 China is represented in the Future of Payments
Working Group that derives from the G20 roadmap to improve
cross-border payments,169 with the PBOC actively participating in
developing international standards. 170 China is participating in
CBDC concept- and standard-setting through standard-setting
bodies (SSBs, dealing with topics ranging from CBDC definition and
categories, issues affecting CBDC and virtual currencies, to
regulation). 171 At the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU), China appears to lead research and the standardization of the
CBDC ecosystem and reference architecture.172 China “was the first
to add digital currency-related content to the repository for ISO
20022, a new global standard covering financial information
transferred between financial institutions that includes payment
transactions, securities trading and settlement information, and
credit and debit card information.” 173

interoperability of CBDC, ISO 20022 is among notable common data
and message standards and will likely play a role in “enabling
interoperability with other payment systems.” 174 The PBOC has
discussed cutting-edge issues with not only multinational financial
institutions but also regulators of different economies and
universities. 175 China has “introduced standards” on CBDC in
certain economies involved in the BRI,176 and it is reported that the
Legal Entity Identifier will be both used in China’s CBDC ecosystem
as part of the BRI.177
In addition, China proposes international principles for CBDC
design, addressing various issues including the international use of
CBDC and monitoring and information sharing.178 The PBOC has
reportedly raised these proposals with “other central banks and
monetary authorities.”179 China appears to propose the principle of
“no detriment,” “compliance,” and “interconnectivity” for CBDC
regulation,180 which involves CBDC’s cross-border use.181 The first
requirement of “no detriment,” also seemingly called the “do not
harm” 182 or “no disruption” principle, 183 means that one state’s
CBDC should not disrupt other states’ currency sovereignty and
their monetary and financial stability, along with consumer
protection and fair competition.184 This appears to involve avoiding

negative spillover effects on the economies of China and other
jurisdictions (e.g., currency substitution).185
The second requirement is “compliance,” requiring CBDC crossborder payments system to be compliant with the regulations of all
connected jurisdictions (e.g., capital management, foreign exchange
regulation). 186 Additionally, information flow and funds flow
between jurisdictions may be synchronized to promote trade,
bolster the real economy and deter illicit activities (e.g., satisfying
AML and countering the financing of terrorism (“CTF”)
requirements (together AML/CTF), addressing tax evasion).187 The
synchronization of information and fund flows would “facilitate
regulators to monitor the transactions for compliance.”188
The third requirement is “interconnectivity”: cross-border
payments should, instead of a single CBDC being used for
transactions on both sides of the border, involve interoperability
between different jurisdictions’ domestic CBDC systems and
between domestic CBDC systems and existing payment systems.189
Here, the PBOC “prefers a system where domestic CBDCs are
converted to other currencies as payments cross borders.” 190
According to the DCI Director-General Mu Changchun, PBOC “also
propose[s] a scalable and overseen foreign exchange platform
supported by DLT (distributed ledger technology like blockchain)
or other technologies.”.191
China works on broader issues related to CBDC, particularly
technology, and has been proactive in engaging in international
standard-setting for new technologies. 192 For instance, the BSN
reportedly “envisages” a “standardized digital currency transfer
method and payment procedure.”193 If the BSN manages to develop

DCI is proactive in developing the blockchain standard system, and
leads a number of working groups and standardization projects in

4. CHINA’S CBDC APPROACH: SELECTIVE RESHAPING?
Based on these features, China may selectively reshape
international economic governance through e-CNY, particularly the
US dollar-based international financial system and order. It is due
to, inter alia, the development of CBDC systems and possible
reduced reliance on the dollar. 196
4.1. What Is “Selective”?
CBDC is an area in which China has an advantage in both
technology as well as in standards. Potentially, China could utilize
its first-mover advantage in usage and technology. For instance,
digital yuan may “enable China to internationalize digital currency
payments before other countries’ CBDCs emerge.”197 This is based
on China’s strengths, not only in CBDC, but also within the related
areas of FinTech and e-commerce, more generally.198 Being selective
is not uncommon in China’s practice of economic governance China is also selective in its deregulation efforts.199
CBDC involves an emerging new technology, lacking in the
areas of international standards, practical experience and design.200
E-CNY is “at the most advanced stage” within existing CBDC

projects, 201 and its trial has extended its lead over different
economies’ efforts in exploring a CBDC.202 The PBOC, state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), and government subsidiaries had reportedly
filed over eighty patents relating to CBDC through 2020.203
For standards, the PBOC’s standard system spans from “general
requirements, business operation, interoperability, wallet, security
and regulation.”204 CBDC is closely linked with digital payment. 205
China’s digital payment development is, arguably, moving faster
than the rest of the world, “with payment systems even in countries
with far wealthier populations, such as the United States, lagging on
ease, efficiency, and cost.”206
4.2. What Is “Reshaping”?
E-CNY may lead to a multifaceted reshaping of the international
financial order. Reshaping in this context includes: China’s reduced
reliance on the U.S. dollar, the impact of China’s technology and
standards on both bilateral and multilateral frameworks concerning
FinTech and CBDC, and other related impacts on the international
financial order (e.g., the possible emergence of currency “zones”). 207

likely reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar-based international financial

system. 208 For technology, CBDC builds on FinTech that may
reshape, amongst others, “global production and financial
networks.” 209 It has been said that “digitization of the entire
monetary base and a speedy payments framework” would reduce
reliance on the U.S. dollar-based international financial system.210
New technology provides an opportunity for developing countries,
such as China, to adopt more efficient transaction methods than
those of even wealthier nations.211 It will be arguably easier for new
technologies to start from a clean slate, as opposed to encountering
headwinds from vendors and users of pre-existing technologies.212
Particularly, cross-border payment is arguably the area in which
China’s CBDC could maximize its effects and thus help develop a
new international settlement system.213 E-CNY has the “potential to
shift the world payments system in favor of the RMB, [and may]
provide a completely new and different mechanism, entirely
removed from these traditional payments systems.”214 The currency
may be used outside China’s borders, particularly by economies
with close links with China.215 E-CNY could potentially enable the
direct exchange of currencies and bypass the use of the U.S. dollar if
an efficient peer-to-peer transfer in e-CNY becomes commonly
accepted in international business. 216 China’s CBDC would
introduce a new payment rail, the system transferring funds
between payers and payees, that could arguably reduce reliance on
the U.S. dollar and dollar-dominated payment rails.217

China's Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency

109

For the China-led network of trade and investment, China will
likely build on such a network to reduce reliance on the US dollar.218
The reach of e-CNY may be expanded along the BRI as a possible
U.S. dollar alternative.219 If properly managed, e-CNY transfers may
simplify “cross-border RMB-denominated settlement”, with lower
currency exchange costs by reducing the need of an intermediary
currency (particularly the U.S. dollar), yielding improved efficiency
and convenience.220 As trade with China may be billed in RMB, this
has been dubbed by Charles Gave as: “Asia’s new monetary order”,
claiming that “‘parallel infrastructure’ is now in place” that permits
states to “move between currencies.” 221 E-CNY may be used by
investors for investment relating to China or in economies with
volatile
currencies,
with
“underdeveloped
financial
infrastructures.”222 E-CNY may also be attractive to some emerging
markets if cross-border payments become more efficient and less
costly and if these markets intend to “reduce their dependence on
the dollar for geostrategic reasons.”223
Besides the trade and investment discussed above, China may
use its financial network to reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar,
such as through payment systems and swap lines. For example, eCNY is observed to link with the country’s efforts to develop a new
payment system based on CIPS. 224 CIPS is, to some degree, “an
international payment system for RMB” 225 that could “reduce
exposure of China’s global payments data to the United States.”226
China’s CBDC system may also be integrated with RMB swap lines

to promote the use of RMB. 227 Over thirty swap lines involving
China were established by 2020, “exceeding the number of swap
lines of [many] other states” (with the U.S. having less than half of
this number).228 These RMB swap lines are attributable to China’s
global role as a major supplier of goods, its investment and credit in
developing economies, as well as its efforts to internationalize
RMB.229 These swap lines may reduce the reliance on the U.S. dollar
as they involve the currencies of states to the swap arrangements.
4.2.2. Shaping Future CBDC Frameworks
China’s technology, standards, and infrastructure may play an
important role in bilateral and multilateral frameworks related to
CBDC and related FinTech. Through the potential issuance of
CBDC, central banks would play a greater role in the “regulatory
and policy landscapes of FinTech.” 230 The knowledge and
information of various actors may influence the emergence and
maintenance of international regimes as well as agenda setting.231
For China, “the PBOC has built a relatively complete standard
system.”232 Through e-CNY, China is said to be “the first country to
make a bold statement about the future of global payments and the
type of data the government should have access to.”233 China’s early
push for CBDC helps develop a first-mover advantage in shaping
the evolution of the international payments infrastructure that is

important for cross-border remittances and trade. 234 China will
likely play an influential role in shaping new rules and standards for
CBDC (such as those on cross-currency and cross-border
payments),235 and the ways CBDCs are exchanged and traded in the
international system.236 China will also likely affect the direction of
technological development. 237
As discussed above, China’s
proactive efforts in international governance may affect emerging
standards related to CBDC (e.g., ISO 20022).
4.2.3. Other impacts
E-CNY may affect international economic order in other ways.
China’s currency management may affect “the ideational and
institutional underpinnings of international monetary relations”.238
Indeed, given various factors, including China’s economic heft, eCNY could likely impact the international financial and monetary
system as a whole. 239 E-CNY may also affect the design, policy
choice and regulatory arrangements of other states concerning
CBDC (such as “reshaping domestic finance”).240 BRI states may
learn from and develop CBDCs compatible with e-CNY,241 and eCNY may contribute to the possible emergence of currency “zones”
in the world economy.242 If connectivity is developed, it may be

difficult to break, even if interests change. 243 E-CNY, even if not
widely used, may be “geopolitically significant.”244
4.3 Concluding Thoughts on Selective Reshaping
The three core features of e-CNY (the role of the state, possible
cross-border use, and China’s proactive efforts in international
CBDC governance) contribute to the possibility of selective
reshaping. The role of state is the crucial driving force or “engine”
behind e-CNY and lays a foundation for e-CNY’s possible
international use and impact. There are “state-driven incentives”
behind the e-CNY that could promote various aspects including the
scalability of digital payments.245 E-CNY enables China to form a
state-led design of digital currency, regulation, and ecosystem,
giving the state the crucial role of shaping the future evolvement of
these areas such as digital payment. To illustrate, e-CNY may assist
the government in penetrating China’s strong consumer internet
applications market. 246 China’s CBDC appears to echo China’s
efforts to put forward Chinese initiatives and plans in international
economic governance and to enhance its capacity in global financial
governance. 247 For instance, CBDC may enable international
transactions to be “better controlled.”248
The possible international use of e-CNY and China’s proactive
efforts in affecting international governance are the main pathways
for possible selective reshaping. E-CNY fits with China’s major
policy initiative to internationalize RMB.249 It is observed that such
international use would promote the role of RMB in international

transactions (e.g., pricing and settlement), financing of projects in
the region, and its acceptance as a reserve currency.250
E-CNY seems to be China’s latest major effort to reshape the
international monetary system. It follows efforts such as RMB’s
inclusion in Special Drawing Rights (an international reserve asset
created by the IMF) in 2016.251 E-CNY is observed to be critical in
reconfiguring the global monetary system, 252 being “a key
component of an alternative to the dollar-based order.”253
5. THE SUSTAINABILITY OF CHINA’S CBDC APPROACH
CBDC systems, along with innovation, provide a unique
opportunity to reshape the international financial system.254 CBDC
systems, including their cross-border use, start with a clean slate.255
For digital money, “the field is on the cusp of major changes that
have the potential to reshape cross-border payments and
remittances.”256
From the perspective of possible CBDC international use, the
sustainability of China’s CBDC approach (selective reshaping)
would face economic, political economy, as well as legal and
regulatory factors. Multiple factor analysis provides a holistic view
of the future of China’s CBDC approach. These factors should not
be seen as mutually exclusive. Instead, these factors are related. For
instance, resilience standards are related to economic factors of costs
(e.g., costs concerning CBDC design to build resilience), and also
involve legal considerations (e.g., rules on the roles of different

actors to ensure resilience). 257 They concern domestic and, more
importantly, international aspects, since China’s rising role in
international governance is bound by its own “structural and social
conditions” and those internationally. 258 These factors will both
affect and be affected by e-CNY. Meanwhile, these factors are not
exhaustive. For instance, cultural factors may concern users and
other stakeholders, involving preferences such as those over
different payment methods.259
Given the lack of detailed information and the fast development
of e-CNY, this part provides broad and primary examples to
illustrate the open issues that deserve attention and works to
provide a framework to analyze the future of China’s CBDC
approach.
5.1 Economic Factors
Various economic factors would affect the performance of eCNY. These factors pertain to economic efficiency and welfare.260
They raise crucial questions including CBDCs’ operational
arrangements (including operation costs and tasks), the publicprivate sector relationship, and consumer welfare (e.g., adoption
costs concerning CBDC).261
5.1.1. CBDC-Related Costs
Costs related to CBDC would affect different stakeholders (e.g.,
businesses and end-users) and e-CNY’s operation. On the one hand,
CBDC may reduce transaction costs compared to traditional

currency. 262 A properly managed CBDC could reduce current
frictions that hamper local and global transactions for individuals
and firms.263 On the other hand, costs arise from different aspects,
including the system’s operation and development, regulation,
technical design and interconnection with different systems. CBDC
issuance “would require capital expenditure and impose running
costs”. 264 The PBOC has recognized that this resource-intensive
nature of CBDC acts as a constraint, particularly on its scalability.265
The regulation of the CBDC, such as data regulation, would also
affect costs. Stringent restrictions on data use by businesses may
affect potential business models in a CBDC ecosystem and increase
costs to end-users (such as indirect fees).266 Sophisticated technical
design (e.g., the CBDC ledger) may work to promote the CBDC
adoption but will also raise costs. 267 CBDC also involves
interconnections with other systems and the apportionment of costs
and revenues across the system.268
In particular, the costs to businesses are considerable and some
may be passed to end-users. The fee arrangement of e-CNY is as
follows: the PBOC does not charge intermediaries or end-users fees;
intermediaries are prohibited from charging individual users; but
intermediaries may charge merchants (as an incentive for businesses
to enter the market, with fees kept in check). 269 While tier two
institutions will invest in equipment and technology,270 it is to be
seen whether and how tier 2.5 institutions would take on these
responsibilities. Evidently, firms will require viable business models
to recover CBDC-related capital expenditures and running costs.271
Different jurisdictions have identified cost recovery and
incentivizing private sector participation as open issues in CBDC

development.272 CBDCs also require higher business continuity and
resilience standards for intermediaries, increasing costs for
intermediaries who may in turn invest less in this regard than “is
systemically optimal”. 273 These costs would involve Chinese and
even foreign entities and largely depend on the CBDC design, which
is as yet unfinalized.274
5.1.2. The Implications for Markets
E-CNY’s implications for markets will affect the sustainability of
China’s CBDC approach. Market implications affect not only
businesses but also users’ choice of e-CNY in particularly currency
and payment markets. CBDC will likely bring institutional change
while the private sector continues to adopt fintech innovations.275
Examples include the possible substantial changes to the retail
payments system.276 E-CNY has advantages (e.g., lower cost, offline
function) compared with third-party mobile payment platforms in
China, while these payment platforms have been incorporated into
the e-CNY payment system. 277 Given the great inertia in retail
payment behaviors and the convenience of private payment
services,278 it remains to be seen whether e-CNY will change user
habits. Legal reform may also be relevant to the uptake of e-CNY.
Payment platforms (and relatedly, big tech firms) will have much
less access to data than before in the e-CNY ecosystem, and this will
affect their pre-existing competitiveness based on data.279 Another
issue is that the introduction of authorized operators in e-CNY
narrows market players, compared with fiat money distributed by
all commercial banks and other actors (e.g., exchanges). It also
remains to be seen whether and how e-CNY can avoid financial
disintermediation. Time will tell whether CBDC will bring major
policy changes and whether it could dislocate the existing industry

structure for example in relation to banking. 280 Relating to
international use of CBDC, it has been stated that “depending on its
attributes, a domestic CBDC could potentially compete with private
digital currencies, foreign CBDCs, private payment platforms, or
banks.” 281 CBDC thus may affect markets both in terms of
businesses and users.
5.1.3. Macro-Financial Implications
Macro-financial implications of CBDC around the issuing state
and other jurisdictions involved may affect the sustainability of
China’s CBDC approach. These macro-financial implications
include potential financial stability risks, contagion effects, capital
flow volatility, currency substitution risk, and the configurations of
reserve currency by central banks. 282 Even if a CBDC is solely
intended for domestic use, it will have implications going “beyond
borders.”283 This is recognized in a principle stated in the PBOC’s
work on cross-border payments for CBDC, which seeks to “avoid
negative spillover effects” on China and other states, e.g., currency
substitution.284
5.1.4. Other Economic Factors
Other economic factors affect the e-CNY’s possible reshaping of
the international financial order. In particular, economic factors
(e.g., confidence in the overall stability of a currency’s value,

liquidity, the issuing state’s transactional network) affect the
currency’s international position.285
A key feature of e-CNY is China’s utilization of its transaction
network to promote the currency (as discussed above). In the
network, the possible contexts of CBDC international use include
retail usage (e.g., payments in retail CBDCs across borders), 286
international remittances, as well as trade in goods and services. 287
The scale of the transactional network of a currency issuing state in
the international economy will affect international use of its
currency. 288 Trade provides a primary example. The use of a
currency in world trade, especially for invoicing, is important for
enhancing the systemic importance of the currency’s role in
international commerce.289
However, the cross-border use of e-CNY mainly hinges on RMB
internationalization policy. 290 RMB internationalization continues
to face challenges, such as the development of the domestic financial
markets and convertibility (especially in the capital account, due to
capital controls). 291 For instance, “[d]eep capital markets with a
large availability of safe assets and hedging capabilities” are
important for an international currency. 292 Many economists are
sceptical as to whether the impact of e-CNY could overcome
challenges posed by the yuan’s convertibility.293 E-CNY is likely to
face similar roadblocks in its cross-border use.

particularly currency internationalization. 294 The analysis below
focuses on the role of state that is a feature of China’s CBDC practice,
and the new landscape of emerging digital currencies particularly
other CBDCs, which will affect the outcome of China’s
proactiveness in international governance.
5.2.1. The Relationship between the State and Market
The relationship between the state and market in China is
different from many other states where the role of the state is less
prominent. China is observed to develop “CBDC with Chinese
characteristics.”295 For example, the centralized governance model
of e-CNY is consistent with China’s traditional “state-centric modes
of governance,” 296 including “centralis[ing] control of the
underlying monetary instrument across all payment systems” and
“controlling currency inflows and outflows into the RMB area.”297
In other words, the role of the state in e-CNY, as discussed above,
echoes China’s “unique mode of monetary governance that reflects
a different relationship between the state and market” from the
West. 298 In contrast, the US could “choose[] to leave certain
functions to the private sector that China aims to have the public
sector provide.”299 Given these different models of governance, the
development of CBDC involves the complex task of defining roles
and finding the proper balance between the responsibilities of the
private sector, the public sector and the central bank.300 For instance,
CBDC likely implicates the state’s role in digital payments. 301
Theoretically China’s monetary system may even both “conflict and

harmonize with the existing liberal system.”302 The way that e-CNY
develops and the interaction between the state and the market in this
context is yet to be seen.
5.2.2. Currency and Payment Solution Competition
The way CBDCs operates in international transactions is being
explored by different economies. The ECB has reportedly indicated
that a digital euro may help enhance the attractiveness and
international status of the euro.303 Cross-border CBDC transactions
are being tested by France and Switzerland.304
Other digital currencies and payment rails, including CBDCs
possibly issued by other major economies like the US and EU, will
likely compete with e-CNY. The emergence of CBDC could
intensify the competition between currencies and incentivize central
banks to respond (or not) to other states’ CBDC decisions.305
On the one hand, technological evolution may affect power
structures.306 Different economies may seek competitive advantages
in the international economic order.307 As a first mover, e-CNY may
enhance the role of RMB, particularly in the region, if everything
goes smoothly. For the configuration of reserve currencies, the
changes will evolve faster on a regional, rather than a global, level.
This is because “[r]egional patterns, where trade connections are
tighter, and political pressures stronger, may instead evolve more

rapidly.”308 E-CNY is likely to affect economies in the region that
“conduct RMB-denominated transactions with China.”309
On the other hand, it is not easy for e-CNY to enhance its role in
the international financial system. The RMB is currently of “limited
importance” as an international reserve, trade and investment
currency, and recent figures show that the reliance on payment
infrastructure to promote RMB internationalization faces limits.310
Reduced costs in using foreign currencies through CBDC may
strengthen established currencies given their significant network
effects. 311 Reserve currencies (e.g., the dollar, euro) may “become
even more dominant if available digitally at a lower cost and to a
wider user base.” 312 The US dollar and the euro are “deeply
enmeshed in the international financial architecture,” making it
difficult to substantially change the international financial order.313
Jan Knoerich argues that “[s]ome advanced-economy CBDCs, even
if launched belatedly, might draw on their stronger and more
internationally integrated financial systems to leapfrog the
DCEP.”314
Payment solutions are among the major competitors of a
CBDC.315 For cross-border payments, e-CNY will face competition
with the correspondent banking model and dollar-dominated
payment rails (e.g., PayPal).316
The landscape of the future is unclear. Competition among
currencies and payment solutions is likely to affect the promotion of
Chinese standards outside China. Whether pre-existing path
dependence on the dominant international currency and
institutional equilibrium will be broken, which happened when the
USD became the world’s reserve currency, is yet to be seen.317

5.2.3. Other Political Economy Factors
Other political economy factors (e.g., geo-economic
relationships) affect the traditional RMB and its international
position.318 This also applies to e-CNY. The international use of
CBDC may involve sovereign power and international relations,
and require significant global coordination. 319 For instance, the
implications of CBDC for different states’ monetary sovereignty are
to be seen, 320 particularly with a seeming shift towards a “more
competitive and conflictual” mindset that can be found in the US
regarding its bilateral relationship with China. 321 Uncertainties
could exist regarding e-CNY’s capability of cross-border payments,
given the impact of politics on trade and capital flows.322 Moreover,
a risk may exist regarding “a widening gap between countries which
are able to more quickly adapt to changing circumstances and
countries that lack the means to safeguard themselves from
potential adverse effects.”323 This may affect the reception of CBDC
by different economies.
Many questions beyond the scope of this article remain open.
Will a more fragmented international financial order emerge? Or
will digital currencies lead to a reorientation of the international
financial architecture?324

5.3. Legal and Regulatory Factors
CBDC is more demanding of regulation than existing currencies,
and e-CNY faces risks (e.g., cyber risks) within and across China’s
borders.325 It is observed that central banks would need to take on
greater operational and oversight responsibilities regarding the
CBDC system. 326 Regulation concerns a broad range of policy
concerns and domestic and cross-border implementation practices.
CBDC will involve the issues of how to address the protection of
individual rights (particularly privacy) and consumer protection,327
financial integrity, 328 data, and law enforcement. 329 Other issues
include cybersecurity, possible disintermediation at the time of
financial stress, high technical standards and requirements for the
PBOC and the commercial institutions in many aspects ranging
from resilience and reliability to scalability and throughput.330 To
illustrate, “[d]efending against cyber attacks will be made more
difficult as the number of endpoints in a general purpose CBDC
system will be significantly larger than those of current wholesale
central bank systems.”331 E-CNY also needs to manage risks relating
to data (e.g., the treatment of payment data, and data flow).
Several legal and regulatory considerations deserve more
attention here. First, cross-border transactions of CBDC will likely
involve complex issues (such as foreign exchange price-discovery

mechanism).332 CBDCs generate data and concern digital identity
(e.g., those concerning digital wallets). 333 Meanwhile, CBDCs are
likely to be designed initially for domestic payment systems and
users. 334 International payments are more complicated than
domestic ones due to the involvement of more regulations (like
those of foreign exchange settlements), actors, jurisdictions, and
time zones.335 To enhance cross-border payments may also bring
risks and challenges that add to the complexity of CBDC
transactions. 336 The risks of CBDC’s international use include
operational and cyber risks, as well as micro-financial and macrofinancial risks (e.g., financial stability, contagion effects, and volatile
capital flows).337 All these complex issues require substantial effort
and adaptability to have CBDC used in an international context
involving different governance models, regulations and financial
systems.338 Rules are needed to address issues like the access and
use by non-residents to CBDC, and the definition of standards for
cross-currency payments. 339
Second, legal and regulatory factors are closely linked and
embedded into technologies. Technology brings opportunities and
challenges. CBDC operation and policy goals require a set of
complementary technologies to support the core features of
CBDC. 340 CBDC designs may strengthen regulation, such as
enabling issuing central banks to preclude or limit CBDC’s use
outside the issuing jurisdiction, enabling wallets in recipient states
to permit local authorities to impose capital flow regulatory
measures, limiting CBDC circulation through programmability, and

Third, selective reshaping is likely to encounter China-specific
regulatory challenges. These challenges include the potential
tension between the need for RMB internationalization (e.g.,
international circulation through expanding capital outflows,
capital account liberalization, and a flexible exchange rate) and
China’s possible concerns over reduced control over capital flows
and increased fluctuation in the exchange rate. 342 Such tension
could also exist in e-CNY as e-CNY is the digital form of RMB.
These complexities set high requirements for law and regulation.
As reflected in the major and sometimes overlapping issues below,
regulatory and legal responses to these risks are crucial for the longterm sustainability of China’s CBDC approach.
5.3.1. Resiliency
Resiliency is critical to the success of e-CNY. The CBDC system
will need to deal with cyber risks, technical failure, and
counterfeiting.343 The PBOC recognizes that cyberattacks may be a
significant risk if e-CNY becomes systemically significant. 344
Maintaining the system’s resilience will not be easy since technology
faces uncertainties in operation and effect and requires careful
experimentation before its wide adoption. To illustrate, it has been
stated that it is difficult to estimate future volumes, especially given
other developments such as smart device payments and “micro
transactions.”345 In addition, if specific resilience specifications for
CBDC are onerous and could impact its performance (e.g., speed),
this will reduce its functionality and use.346

5.3.2. Interoperability
China’s CBDC “would be connected to existing retail and
wholesale payment systems.” 347 The interoperability between
existing and new systems (including infrastructures) is a complex
issue faced by CBDC 348 and will have domestic and international
challenges. Interoperability means “technical or legal compatibility
that enables a system or mechanism to be used in conjunction with
other systems or mechanisms” and “allows participants in different
systems to conduct clear and settle payments or financial
transactions across systems without participating in multiple
systems.”349 For instance, digital yuan is expected to be compatible
with DLT or the intermediaries’ choice of technology. 350
Interoperability involves issues such as lowering the barriers to
membership of different systems (such as through common
messaging standards and operating times), and developing
common business arrangements (such as a designated settlement
agent between two systems concerning select payments).351
Internationally, interoperability is relevant to CBDC systems of
various economies, and to CBDC systems and pre-existing payment
systems.352 Interoperability may need to be enabled at wholesale
and retail levels, such as it being possibly “enabled between e-CNY
and other retail systems and the conversion of e-CNY and other fiat
currencies [that] would be processed at virtual borders between
digital wallets.”353 For instance, compatibility between currencies is
crucial for interoperability (i.e., “technical or legal compatibility”)354
by ensuring the efficiency and safety of money transfers.355 Notably,
interoperability between cross-border CBDC systems is likely to
encounter more hurdles and considerations than that in domestic

CBDC operations. 356
Cross-border interoperability involves
challenges like different compliance requirements and consumer
protection rules concerning payment.357 A compatible ID scheme,
without requiring an international database regarding CBDC endusers, may be needed to combat illicit finance.358
It is to be seen how e-CNY addresses interoperability issues.
Interoperability among financial systems is at the core of the third
principle of interconnectivity that China proposes regarding
CBDC’s cross-border use. A key example of China’s efforts towards
developing interoperability is its involvement in the mCBDC
This project faces roadblocks in aspects like
Bridge. 359
governance.360 The mCBDC Bridge’s operating model builds on the
Inthanon-LionRock concept. 361 Under that concept, international
payments are “processed through a jointly operated ‘corridor
network’ which links up” separate national wholesale CBDC
networks. 362 The mCBDC Bridge considers establishing a single
mCBDC system across jurisdictions, following a model that “would
apply the concept of creating new multilateral payment platforms”
and go beyond basic compatibility.363 This model implies deeper
integration and high levels of cooperation that builds on “having a
single set of rules, a single technical system, and a single set of
participants”. 364 Such deeper integration would help promote
operational functionality and efficiency, but increases operational
costs and “the governance and control hurdles (e.g., wider access
might allow more efficient settlement but increases other risks) as
well as policy issues.”365 It is observed that such multi-CBDC design
principles require global coordination so as to limit any regulatory
arbitrage. 366 The requirement of international coordination is
challenging regarding CBDC given the different national positions
and sensitive issues concerning CBDC (e.g., data and sovereignty).

As another example, China has built a blockchain-based e-CNY
distributed ledger so that operational institutions may perform tasks
like cross-institution reconciliations for the exchange of digital
currencies with most commercial banks and the general public.368
Here, technical standards for blockchain interconnectivity,
blockchain scalability, privacy protection, information security and
auditing are all problems that need to be addressed.369
Moreover, there are other challenges such as domestic
circumstances and tensions among different considerations.
Importantly, domestic circumstances are likely to affect
interoperable system designs. 370 China’s CBDC approach and
domestic circumstances are not the same as those of other states. For
instance, China’s social conditions, the population’s familiarity with
digital payment, and the scalability of FinTech are helpful for
promoting e-CNY,371 but such conditions do not necessarily exist in
other jurisdictions involved in the international use of e-CNY.
Moreover, there is a tension between sharing limited information
about CBDC’s operation to maintain a “lead” and openly sharing
the lessons to promote soft power advantages and
interoperability.372 It is to be seen how the e-CNY system would
address these issues and interact with the international financial
system concerning interoperability.

5.3.3. Adaptability
Adaptability, or flexibility, is an important issue in this
discussion. A CBDC ecosystem should be flexible to future demand
and be able to interoperate with new systems while maintaining
system resilience. 373 Adaptability is also useful to address the
various use cases of CBDC. All these explain why a flexible

approach is explored by e-CNY. E-CNY benefits from the low
issuance cost and low traceability of cryptocurrencies while
maintaining the advantages of physical currency (e.g., fiat currency
status).374 For e-CNY, institutions in the second-tier are relatively
free “to choose the right technology in the distribution layer.375 Each
of the e-CNY pilots is reversible, with each operator having an exit
plan.376
It is to be seen how e-CNY will perform on adaptability across
daily operations, while striking a balance with stability. “The
governance of the daily operations often requires immediate
responses,” but this will likely involve uncertainties (caused by
factors like the difficulties in predefining every requirement and
changes occurring in the operation) and unexpected behavior. 377
Equally, flexibility needs to be balanced with stability, which is
important for social and economic systems.378 The changes induced
by regulatory measures should not risk outcomes (e.g., data leakage
379 ) that are irreversible or unacceptable. 380
Potential ways of
avoiding irreversible harm involve establishing a strong oversight
system to ensure reversibility, 381 and identifying and choosing
among a range of policy options regarding potential and real
problems.

the international level.382 Domestic laws will play a crucial role in
international use of the CBDC. The mobility of CBDC concerns
monetary autonomy of states. Sovereignty and compliance with
domestic law are highlighted in the first two principles (i.e., no
detriment, compliance) that China proposes regarding CBDC crossborder use.383 They are likely to involve issues ranging from data to
foreign exchange. For instance, China may need to satisfy currency
exchange regulations of other states for the international use of eCNY (e.g., the distribution of e-CNY to foreign nationals).384 RMBinvoiced international trade may utilize China’s CBDC, “but this is
still subject to consultation with other central banks and entities.”385
Coordination of regulation is important to address problems in
the cross-border operation of CBDCs that are largely attributable to
different national laws. International standards for CBDC-related
systems and services (such as digital identity repositories) are
needed. 386 Important issues for the international use of CBDC
include the aligning of regulatory frameworks, consistent technical
and regulatory standards (including AML/CTF checks), identity
management concerning CBDC users, cross-border access to
domestic CBDC, and payment system access. 387 More generally,
international coordination is needed regarding capital flow
management, treatment of data and privacy, tax, and payments
rules.388 Other relevant issues include rules on settlement finality,
participation criteria for payment systems, and rules on the conflict
of laws.389 Overall, central banks of the issuing and recipient states
would need to agree on and have insights into aggregate crossborder use of CBDC, in the case of account-based currencies.390

China's Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency

Coordination between institutions like central banks and related
public authorities is crucial to understand and manage any
unintended effects of CBDC usage (e.g., a CBDC’s impact on another
jurisdiction’s monetary policy or financial stability or use in
avoiding rules outside a jurisdiction where sufficient regulation is
not in place). 391 A cross-border CBDC may generate other
challenges that have the potential to “spillover” into other
economies. 392 Coordination and information exchange among
different institutions will help to address these issues.
International coordination is challenging, although various
projects are working to promote international collaboration on
CBDC. Privacy protection provides a prime example. In the
economy and the monetary system, the centrality of data (e.g.,
personal and business data) is increasing. 393 Data bring new
challenges for privacy.394 It is argued that other economies using eCNY “will find it difficult to control or monitor the flow of the
Digital Yuan, and will have to take measures to protect the privacy
of their domestic users.”395 States also have divergent standards on
privacy. Ideally central banks would reach agreements on the level
of privacy for users making or receiving international payments.396
However, an international dialogue on the degree of anonymity in
CBDCs will likely encounter obstacles, given different approaches
and divergent interests of major economies, such as the US, the EU,
and China. 397 In relation to CBDC, the G7 has indicated various
general principles regarding data collection and processing: data
minimization, transparency and accountability.398 It is to be seen
whether a consensus can be reached. Instead, a group of states may
adopt common standards and affect other states which need to meet
these rules to access the group’s CBDC network.399
Behind the challenges in international coordination are the
complicated policy trade-offs of different considerations such as

security and efficiency. These considerations will affect the setting
of regulatory expectations and implementation. To illustrate, the
balance between fighting financial crimes and privacy protection
will affect whoever may access which parts of transaction data (such
as payment data in the context of evolving data protection law) and
under what circumstances.400 The identification of users is useful to
promote the safety and integrity of the payment system through
deterring fraud and combating illicit activities such as money
laundering. 401 This requires close collaboration with regulators,
such as tax authorities.402 However, challenges exist regarding how
to protect privacy.
When CBDC infrastructure needs to
substantially expand its capacity due to increased demand, this
could “require compromises on some features that might otherwise
be desirable (such as computationally demanding privacy
techniques or programmable payments) as additional complexities
could increase the processing demand on the system.”403 It is to be
seen whether and how “policy synergies between anonymity, risk
reduction, and financial inclusion” may be realized.404 Essentially,
the balances of motivations and objects of different states regarding
CBDC, as well as national circumstances and capacity (including the
characteristics of the payment systems, staffing), vary widely. 405
These trade-offs may mean that “not all motivations can be realized
simultaneously.” 406 Potential solutions need to be carefully
explored and justified to address these issues. This may require a
strong regulatory and technological capacity of the issuing
jurisdiction and other jurisdictions involved.
5.4. Concluding Thoughts on the Sustainability of China’s Approach
The landscape of selective reshaping is in flux and remains
unclear at this stage. E-CNY is a moving target in terms of its

operation and development. New regional reserve currencies may
arise due to new CBDCs’ attractive features.407 If properly managed,
CBDC will increase efficiency, reduce the risks and costs of crossborder payments (such as reducing the intermediation chains in the
payment processes), improve integration, and enhance safety and
technical compatibility. 408 E-CNY may strengthen RMB’s role in
some regions across the Asia-Pacific. The international use of eCNY will likely start from a payment infrastructure system, and is
more likely to reshape cross-border payment than the investment
and reserve currency system due to factors such as the need for
greater international liquidity of the RMB.409 At the same time, “the
credibility and stability of institutions, degree of financial openness,
and the rule of law, as well as geopolitical forces, remain essential
ingredients to currency internationalization and tend to move
slowly.”410 For example, adequate accountability and supervisory
arrangements are necessary.411 These will likely help increase the
confidence in e-CNY. On the whole, economic, political economy,
legal and regulatory factors will affect the trust in e-CNY.
6. CONCLUSION
Analysis of e-CNY requires consideration of the role of the state,
the possible extension of e-CNY into cross-border transactions, and
China’s proactive approach to international governance. Through
the implementation of CBDC, China may be able to selectively
reshape global finance, which is among the new domains of
international relations.412 However, the long-term sustainability of
selective reshaping would be profoundly affected by economic,
political economy, legal and regulatory factors. That said, the latest
geo-economic tensions may speed up the rolling out of China’s
CBDC and its use. International economic governance is likely to be
reshaped along with reduced reliance on the US dollar by some

countries like China. A new international payment system and
ecosystem parallel to the existing Western-led ones may emerge
over time.
The interaction and impact of e-CNY on the international
economic governance deserve further research, such as whether and
how e-CNY might chart a novel course for the international financial
system. Trust in the currency is crucial, and it is affected by many
factors including the governance, openness of a currency system,
and economic development of the issuing country.413 It would be
crucial to analyze the development of e-CNY, the influencing factors
of China’s CBDC approach, 414 and its impact on the future
international financial systems.415
