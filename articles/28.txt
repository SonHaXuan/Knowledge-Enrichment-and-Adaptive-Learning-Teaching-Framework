ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital asset backed to fiat currencies issued and
regulated by reputable national financial institutions. Bearing in mind accelerating developments
in financial technology and CBDC, this study explored tourists’ adoption of CBDC as a payment
method by focusing on the relationship between attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral
control, mass media coverage, fear of missing out relative advantages, and perceived risk. A sociopsychological theory was utilized as a theoretical framework. The survey data were collected from
China, Korea, and the US. The proposed framework strongly supported Digital Korean Won and
Digital Yuen.

Introduction
While the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a loss of more
than $USD 4 trillion in the global GDP for the years 2020
and 2021 (Vanzetti et al., 2021), central bank digital
currency (CBDC) could assist in international travel
recovery by significantly lowering payment fees (e.g.,
person-to-person payments and cross-border payments)
and boosting liquidity within transactions. CBDCs are
digital assets backed by fiat currencies issued and regu­
lated by reputable national financial institutions. The
sole purpose of CBDC is to untangle the application of
monetary and fiscal policy and to encourage financial
involvement of unbanked individuals (Seth, 2021).
As of 31 March 2021, the sum total of money in the
world (notes, coins, money in deposits, and checking
account) is about $USD 40 trillion; however, this number
exceeds $USD 1.3 quadrillion when money in the form of
investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies are
included (V. Kumar, 2021). Today, more than 90% of all
money exists only on computer servers and most money
is just electronic data (Harari, 2015). Hence, even though
the evolution of money has progressed from Sumerian
barley money (around 3000 BC) to today's CBDC, Harari
(2015) points that both versions of money share two
universal principles, universal convertibility and univer­
sal trust.

Barrdear and Kumhof (2021) suggest that the CBDC
supply of 30% of gross domestic product (GDP) against
a government debt security could invariably raise GDP
by 3% while considerably enhancing the central bank’s
capacity to balance the series of economic expansion
and contraction. In case of bank insolvency and potential
banking panic, which can lead to payment disruption,
CBDCs tend to mitigate banking panics with payment
disruption, while fostering user trust (Williamson, 2021).
The central bank is steadfast compared to the repository
sector, and, hence, individuals in their market forecast­
ing could contemplate this feature as favourable, lead­
ing to the shift in the deposit market where the central
bank arises as a deposit monopolist, endangering longterm financial projects (Fernández-Villaverde et al.,
2021). Furthermore, in order to achieve the efficiency
and reliability of person-to-person and/or cross-border
transactions with robust traceability, verifiability and
consistency, CBDC should be designed on both distrib­
uted ledger technology (DLT) and traditional central
bank infrastructure (Lee et al., 2021). Similarly, as one
of the COVID-19 recovery tactics for cruise tourism,
R’adic et al. (2020) recommend the usage of distributed
ledger technology in payments as a highly efficient
method for improving liquidity with cheap, fast, scalable,
and reliable transactions. The general acceptance of
CBDCs as a modern form of liquidity could be related

to the herding phenomena; however, Kyriazis (2020)
argues that the herding phenomena in digital currencies
market was evident only in bull markets. Thus, encoura­
ging CBDCs should be a methodical and universal task,
with a clear goal to assist system objectives and prevent
potential financial risks, as CBDCs can enhance the eco­
nomic growth rate (Tong & Jiayou, 2021). Accordingly, as
CBDCs are the most reliable form of digital currency, 110
countries are at one stage or another of CBDC develop­
ment (Okuwoga, 2021). The demand for fast, reliable,
and real-time global payment has grown in tourism
(Auer & Böhme, 2020). Hence, there is a growing number
of central banks that are willing to provide a real-time
global payment services to international tourists (Auer
et al., 2021). Based on the previous studies and bearing
in mind accelerating developments in financial technol­
ogy and CBDCs, there is an urgent need for academic
research in the field of tourism and hospitality related to
adoption of CBDCs by international tourists.
The current study described here sets out to explore
adoption of CBDCs by international tourists. Specifically,
this analysis examines a behavioral intention toward the
adoption of CBDCs by international tourists based on the
Ajzens’ Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991)
and relationships between TPB constructs and mass
media coverage construct based on Katz and
Lazarsfelds’ two-step flow theory (Katz & Lazarsfeld,
1955), fear of missing out (FOMO) construct defined by
McGinnis (2020), relative advantages construct
grounded on Rogers (2003) diffusion of innovation the­
ory and perceived risk construct, built from Bauer’s
(1960) theory of perceived risk (TPR), under the modera­
tion of the Digital Yuen, Digital Korean Won, and Digital
US Dollar. The significance of moderators is in delineat­
ing the variations in the robustness of the interrelation
between a covariate and outcome (Castano Silva et al.,
2019) as it refers to an occurrence where a variable
modifies the strength between exogenous and endo­
genous variables (Khan et al., 2020). To accomplish this
task, the following research question is addressed: How
is the inception of CBDCs affecting international tourists
behavioral intention toward adoption of CBDCs as pay­
ment method?
Accordingly, the present research aimed (1) to
empirically test the impact of the inception of CBDCs
on international tourists behavioral intention toward
adoption of CBDCs as a payment method, (2) to deepen
the TPB by taking into account the influence of mass
media coverage, fear of missing out, relative advan­
tages, and perceived risk that are pertinent to the
CBDCs payments in international tourism, (3) to dis­
cover the moderating role of the Digital Yuen, Digital
Korean Won, and Digital US Dollar. To achieve the

153

objectives of this study, the authors employed
a deductive approach accompanied by a crosssectional time horizon and quantitative techniques for
data collection. Furthermore, a multivariate data assess­
ment and process is established in this study to achieve
the study objectives. Due to the novelty of the study,
the situational analysis approach was used as it allows
usage of data narrative and historical materials from
financial technology websites, specialized business, and
international financial markets television networks,
financial technology social media, and specialized
financial technology literatures.
The theoretical value and originality of the present
research lie in revealing the specific relationships within
the behavioral intentions of international tourists toward
adoption of CBDCs as a payment method. Practically,
this study can assist the governments, central banks,
policy makers, and tourism and hospitality stakeholders
in understanding the underlying mechanism associated
with the adoption of CBDCs by international tourists.

Literature review
Theory of planned behavior
Human behavior is conditioned by numerous elements,
thus reshaping firm behavioral configurations is quite
a demanding task (Ajzen & Schmidt, 2020; Chi & Han,
2021; Han et al., 2021). TPB suggests that most conscious
human behavior can be anticipated by intentions as
long as a person perceives that she/he has control of
their behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Han, 2021; Manosuthi et al.,
2020). Hence, behavioral intention can be foreseen on
the basis of attitude (belief and evaluation in regards of
outcome of behavior), subjective norm (belief in regards
normative beliefs and motivation to comply with such
belief) and perceived behavioral control (belief in
regards of individual control of hers/his behavior; Singh
& Upadhyay, 2021). The study presented here goes
a step further, suggesting that TPB in the specific context
of digital payments as financial behavior within tourism
and hospitality is conceivably affected by outside cir­
cumstances, such as changes in payment methods,
rapid developments in financial technology, and incep­
tion of CBDCs. Accordingly, TPB suggests that human
behavior (e.g., adoption of CBDCs as payment method) is
described to a great extent by attitudes and perception
that individuals hold with regard to specific circum­
stances or processes. However, the adoption of CBDCs
as payment method by international tourists begins
with, as Ajzen and Schmidt (2020) outline,
a comprehensible interpretation of the behavior of inter­
est, the efforts involved, the specific circumstances in

154

which it occurs, and the time horizon. Consequently, this
study applies TPB to international tourists’ adoption of
CBDCs as payment method by focusing on attitudes,
subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, mass
media coverage, fear of missing out, relative advantages,
and perceived risk.

Attitude toward CBDC payment, subjective norm,
perceive behavioral control and behavioral
intention
The most important benefits of CBDCs are liquidity,
rapidness, inexpensiveness, and more coherent pay­
ments in both person-to-person and/or cross-border
transactions (Ye & DeSouza, 2019). Thus, there is
a growing positive attitude toward the adoption of
CBDC payments, as such payment systems lower the
costs of producing physical money with cheaper pay­
ment fees (Ye & DeSouza, 2019). Expensive cash usage
combined with inefficient electronic payment systems
have boosted positive attitudes toward CBDCs as such
payments (through mobile devices) offer enhanced pay­
ment security and efficiency with improved financial
involvement, social progress, and economic growth (De
Bode et al., 2021). As the status quo in the legacy finan­
cial system is seriously challenged due to poor remit­
tances and extraordinarily high fees, many are turning to
digital assets as in some countries (e.g., El Salvador) the
average monthly remittance of legacy financial system
could make up 50% of the total consumer income
(Sigalos, 2021). In a recent Guardtime/ PureProfile sur­
vey, it was noted that there is a broad, global positive
attitude toward adoption of CBDCs as approximately
70% of the people would adopt CBDCs within a year
(Ledger Insights, 2021a). In the same study, the authors
further concluded that even though there is a growing
positive attitude toward the adoption of CBDCs, some
express concerns and perhaps even hesitancy toward
switching away from cash savings or accepting a salary
in CBDCs (Ledger Insights, 2021b).
In 2020, remittance flows to low- and middle-income
countries reached $USD 540 billion due to migrants’
desire to help their families and significant others
(Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and
Development
[KNOMAD],
Global
Knowledge
Partnership on Migration and Development
(KNOMAD), 2021). Hence, as the legacy financial system
is expensive and inefficient, there is a growing norma­
tive belief and motivation toward CBDC adoption as
such payments offer low fees and fast cross-border
payments (Mookerjee, 2021). The social ramifications
of CBDC payments is effecting individuals’ subjective
norm toward adoption of CBDCs due to their inclusive,

consistent, stable and transparent ecosystem, wherein
financial technology is bringing benefit to all by trans­
forming human interaction with money (Gkritsi, 2021).
Furthermore, normative beliefs and motivation toward
CBDC adoption lies in the perception that the nature of
CBDCs is not-for-profit, provides better safeguard of
user privacy, protects consumers’ money against fraud
or theft, and offers more attractive interest rates on
digital assets (Bijlsma et al., 2021). Accordingly, Li
(2021) concludes that fund allocation, non-disclosure
agreements, potential hidden fees, comprehensive
financial planning support, and the rate of return has
direct positive impact on subjective norm toward adop­
tion of CBDCs, as typical Canadian households would
keep 4–55% of their liquid assets in CBDCs. Lastly,
subjective norm toward adoption of CBDCs depends
on CBDCs’ ability to provide 24/7 payments, certain
offline features, elimination of planned maintenance,
fast recovery from operational disruption, ability to
handle large transactional volumes, fast real-time pay­
ment process, high fidelity, and intuitive user interface
with minimum required level of technical literacy (Bank
of England (BoE), 2020).
Individuals perceived behavioral control in the form
of gained knowledge about CBDCs’ integrated infra­
structure, circumstances surrounding the global colla­
borative standard of CBDCs, and the universality of
CBDCs depository and transfers play an important role
in predicting individuals’ adoption of CBDCs (Lee et al.,
2021). Similarly, consumers’ perceived behavioral con­
trol and adoption of CBDCs depends on governmental
trustworthy promises to provide anonymous transac­
tional instrument, clarity on certain restrictions related
to the individual’s holdings, issuing jurisdiction and
interest rates (Cecchetti & Schoenholtz, 2021). Thus, the
adoption of CBDCs is influenced by individual's belief in
regards to hers/his control of payment data, the compe­
titive structure of payment system, performance of pay­
ment services, and data control dispositions (Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), Bank for International
Settlements (BIS), 2021a). Accordingly, to strengthen
perceived behavioral control and CBDC adoption, there
has to be a clear legal framework that has its foundation
in law, offering clarity for the granting, circulating, utiliz­
ing, and potentially terminating CBDC (Cheng et al.,
2021). Market readiness is essential for social and legal
changes, hence individuals’ ability to change their per­
ception on how they think about money and how they
use money plays an important role in CBDC’s adoption
(Cheng et al., 2021). Finally, perceived behavioral control
over CBDCs is stronger in DLT-based CBDCs as such
a platform enables its users to have control and access
over the platform with robust governance and clarity of

JOURNAL OF TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETING

transactions, while the central bank retains complete
control over the quantity of available money (Kiff et al.,
2020). Based on our review of the academic literature
and relevant empirical evidence, we propose the follow­
ing hypotheses:
H1a,b,&c: Attitude toward CBDC payments has a positive
impact on behavioral intention.
H2a,b,&c: Subjective norm has a positive impact on
behavioral intention.
H3a,b,&c: Perceived behavioral control has a positive
impact on behavioral intention.

Mass media coverage and attitude toward CBDC
payment
The mass media are multiform media technologies
with the sole purpose of reaching the broader public
through channels of communication (Cahyanto &
Liu-Lastres, 2020; D. Kumar, 2021). Hence, under­
standing the role of mass media is instrumental to
creating wide public support and positive attitudes
toward CBDCs payments. Furthermore, the mass
media is a powerful apparatus in forcing social
change, and opinion leaders have paramount impor­
tance in affecting public attitudes (Ahem &
Connolly-Ahem, 2019). Katz and Lazarsfelds’ TwoStep Flow Theory (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955) is
a theoretical model of communication that argues
that mass communication is a process divided into
two phases: first, mass media reaches opinion lea­
ders, and second, these opinion leaders carry the
information to the broader public. Katz (1957) con­
firmed that in mass media communication, personal
influence has a dominant role in influencing atti­
tudes and perception. Recently, Ms Christine
Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank,
has addressed the urgent need for quicker and
cheaper payments in which the European Central
Bank (ECB) must play an active role (De Menthon &
Syfuss-Arnaud, 2020). Hence, as payments systems
are dependable on solid network effects, it is evi­
dent that the attractiveness of CBDCs relies on the
users’ positive attitude toward CBDC payments
(European Central Bank (ECB), 2020). The power of
CBDCs lies in moving the value seamlessly (Lau,
2020). A recent study by Genesis Mining shows
that 48% of Americans believe that they will be
a cashless society (Genesis Mining, 2020). Attitude
toward CBDC payments (Genesis Mining, 2020) is
expected to grow; Ackerman (2021) reported that
according to the Chairman of Federal Reserve

155

(FED), digital version of $USD would be issued by
and backed by the U.S. central bank. Hence, the
aforementioned justification led to the following
hypothesis
H4a,b,&c: Mass media coverage has a positive impact on
attitude.

Fear of missing out and attitude toward CBDC
payment and subjective norm
Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a feeling of nervousness
and uneasiness within an individual related to hers/his
perception that there is an event, favourable group,
activity, or opportunity on a horizon that is by far better
than what that individual is doing or experiencing at the
moment (McGinnis, 2020). Moreover, FOMO is “a perva­
sive apprehension that others might be having reward­
ing experiences from which one is absent” (Przybylski
et al., 2013). The race to be the first country to issue fully
functional CBDC is more than just being an innovator in
financial technology, it is a political move related to
independence from US dominance and distance from
the $USD as the world’s reserve currency (Dorn, 2021).
The importance of issuing a CBDC was recognized by
President Xi who expressed unquestionable desire to
make China a world leader in the digital sector and
future industries by launching the Digital Yuan by the
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics (Houston, 2020).
Furthermore, when the Shenzhen government declared
that 10 million yuan ($USD 1.5 million) of the digital
currency (to be spent in 3,389 designated restaurants
and stores) will be distributed among 50,000 partici­
pants selected by lottery, FOMO directly affected atti­
tude toward CBDC and subjective norm of Shenzhen
citizens as more than 1.91 million people applied (accep­
tance rate less than 3%; Kawakami & Kawate, 2020).
Similarly, more than 10 million people applied (accep­
tance rate less than 2%) by using two banking apps
when the Beijing government declared that 40 million
yuan ($USD 6.2 million) of the digital currency will be
given to 200,000 lucky participants to spend about $USD
31 at officially designed businesses (Kharpal, 2021).
Bijlsma et al. (2021) argue that consumer concerns
about privacy and security in commercial banks com­
bined with attractive CBDC interest rates are agitating
consumers, creating a FOMO that is affecting their atti­
tudes, motivation, and normative beliefs toward usage
of the CBDCs. However, Randal K. Quarles, FED Vice Chair
for Supervision, has expressed certain concerns related
to the FOMO that is stirring consumer attitude toward
CBDC payments and consumers subjective norm toward
CBDCs, as he believes that CBDC should be placed under

156

critical analysis before governments get carried away
with CBDC promises and technological novelty
(Smialek, 2021). The enhanced financial literacy among
the tech-savvy population of South Korea, combined
with the nation’s FOMO from the cryptocurrency market
had positive effect on attitude and subjective norm of
South Koreans as nation is set toward quick adoption of
CBDC (Seo, 2021). Moreover, the growing FOMO in
South Koreans that is affecting their attitude and sub­
jective norm toward CBDC is related to government
stimulus checks that could be wired by CBDC to provide
a secure, fast, and cheap payment system to 2.8 million
households’ bank accounts without requiring individual
applications (Seo, 2021). Consequently, the authors put
forward the following hypotheses:
H5a,b,&c: Fear of missing out has a positive impact on
attitude.
H6a,b,&c: Fear of missing out has a positive impact on
subjective norm.

Relative advantages and behavioral intention
Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Rogers, 2003)
lies upon a peculiar kind of communication where
innovation itself is communicated through specific
channels during a certain period in time, while the
innovation itself is disseminated through the social
system. Furthermore, the relative advantage is
described as the degree to which an innovation or
idea is contemplated as predominant compared to
other innovations or ideas by users based on
unquestionable characteristics outlined by users
(Arshad, 2021). CBDC, which has DLT features, is
capable of significantly lowering payment fees,
creating financial inclusion, offering peer-to-peer
and cross-border payments, boosting innovation
and the creation of side chains with various new
services and features, enhancing the monetary pol­
icy, lowering financial crimes, and increasing privacy
of digital transactions (Wong & Maniff, 2020).
Similarly, Adrian (2021) argues how CBDCs are lowcost, profitable, and flexible payment systems that,
in countries with large numbers of “unbanked” peo­
ple can enhance financial inclusion with fast, cheap,
accessible peer-to-peer and cross-border payments.
Accordingly, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is
introducing the Digital Yuen in order to improve
financial inclusion, reduce the informal economy,
gain insight into consumer behavior, and individual
economic activity including illegal transactions
(Kondili, 2021). Due to such robust superiority of

a CBDC, a recent BIS survey showed that 86% of
central banks are actively researching the potential
for the inception of a CBDC, 60% of central banks
are experimenting with the various technologies,
and 14% of central banks have deployed pilot
CBDC projects (Bank for International Settlements
(BIS), 2021b). Hence, the following hypothesis is
proposed:
H7a,b,&c: Relative advantage has a positive impact on
behavioral intention.

Perceived risk and behavioral intention
Bauer in his TPR (Bauer, 1960) argues that in any
transaction, individuals are forced to deal with risks
of uncertainty or the probability of loss notation and
consequences or importance of loss. Today, nearly
all the money is the digital liability of a commercial
bank provided on the system founded by the central
bank (Cecchetti & Schoenholtz, 2021). CBDC’s foun­
dation on digital identification could exacerbate the
risks of currency substitution, improve conditionality
of payments, thereby making central bank money
programmable to support automation and mitigate
risks, put an end to the risks of illiquidity due to
temporary lack of funds or even insolvency, and
mitigate the risks related to data breaches and
data privacy by incorporating varying degrees of
anonymity (Bank for International Settlements (BIS),
2021a). Moreover, CBDCs could provide stable riskfree assets that can be managed without deteriora­
tion, mitigate systemic risk related to extortionate
pricing of end users and micro enterprise, and pre­
vent quasi-monopolistic payment systems based on
DLT designed and implemented by private institu­
tions (Bordo & Levin, 2017). Similarly, Bofinger and
Haas (2021) argue that CBDC can mitigate consumer
risks as they offer reputation and credibility, multi­
currency operability based on DLT, and storage of
value and openness to low-risk payment objects that
are not system-specific. Lastly, consumers can bene­
fit from CBDCs as CBDC can lower the risks in pay­
ment systems by reducing friction and boosting the
speed of transactions and mitigate the risks from
collapse of payment systems in times of crisis (e.g.,
COVID-19 crisis; Allen et al., 2020). This review of
relevant research and data led to the following
hypothesis:
H8a,b,&c: Perceived risk has a positive impact on beha­
vioral intention.

Moderating role of Digital Yuan, Digital Korean
Won, and Digital US Dollar
The development of CBDCs is much more than evolution
of money in the digital economy, as leadership in the
space of CBDCs has direct implications in economic
prosperity, financial inclusion, and foreign affairs as the
fundamentals of money could all be controlled by who
and how steers a path forward (Rabouin, 2021). Hence,
CBDCs have unquestionable potential to influence every
segment of consumers’ well-being as they possess the
strength to enhance the role of money as a public good
(Rabouin, 2021).
PBoC’s introduction of the Digital Yuan offers a digital
currency that can compete with other digital assets (e.g.,
bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, and certain stablecoins) and
other CBDCs, while enabling its users with low cost,
fast, transparent, inclusive person-to-person and/or
cross-border transactions that provide liquidity and
anonymity, and is ultimately supported and endorsed
by President Xi (Deutsche Bank, 2021). Moreover, PBoC
has already conducted more than $USD 5 billion in
Digital Yuan transactions, as China has offered its digital
currency up to foreigners (Rabouin, 2021).
In the recent Bloomberg Index of Most Innovative
Nations 2021, South Korea has become the leading
nation in global information and communication tech­
nology (ICT), which offers them a strong foundation for
further innovations in the sector of financial technology
(Jamrisko et al., 2021). Thus, South Korea is moving
forward to a cashless society (77% of South Koreans
prefer transactions without cash), as the Bank of Korea
(BOK) is set toward the final phase of its CBDC pilot
scheme, which is distribution of the Digital Korean
Won (Stangarone, 2021). Furthermore, with strong gov­
ernment support, the Digital Korean Won could offer
secure, fast, and cheap payment transactions, support
for smart contracts, and enhanced security features
(Stangarone, 2021).
The U.S. is outpaced in financial technology as, they
are no longer the world leader in digital payments and
technological innovation (Rabouin, 2021). However, the
passive approach toward implementation of a CBDC
orchestrated by Mr. Jerome Powell Chairman of FED, is
being pushed backed against by the U.S. Senate as many
senators are vocal in their concerns that if the FED does
not act more aggressively, the $USD position as the
global reserve currency could be challenged (Marte,
2021). Hence, in a recent interview, Jerome Powell,
Chairman of the FED, admitted that CBDC has its merits
and that it could offer a wide range of benefits to the
public good as “are there clear and tangible benefits that

157

outweigh any costs and risks.” (Cox, 2021a). Hence, the
aforementioned justification led to the following
hypotheses:
H9a: The relationship between attitude and behavioral
intention is significantly different across the Digital Yuan,
Digital Korean Won, and Digital US Dollar.
H9b: The relationship between subjective norm and
behavioral intention is significantly different across
the Digital Yuan, Digital Korean Won, and Digital US
Dollar.
H9c: The relationship between perceived behavioral
control and behavioral intention is significantly different
across the Digital Yuan, Digital Korean Won, and Digital
US Dollar.
H9d: The relationship between mass media coverage
and attitude is significantly different across the Digital
Yuan, Digital Korean Won, and Digital US Dollar.
H9e: The relationship between fear of missing out and
attitude is significantly different across the Digital Yuan,
Digital Korean Won, and Digital US Dollar.
H9f: The relationship between fear of missing out and
subjective norm is significantly different across the
Digital Yuan, Digital Korean Won, and Digital US
Dollar.
H9g: The relationship between relative advantage
and behavioral intention is significantly different
across the Digital Yuan, Digital Korean Won, and
Digital US Dollar.
H9h: The relationship between perceived risk and
behavioral intention is significantly different across
the Digital Yuan, Digital Korean Won, and Digital US
Dollar.

Proposed theoretical framework
The proposed model is shown in Figure 1. This concep­
tual framework encompasses variables within the TPB
(attitude toward CBDC payment, subjective norm, and
perceived behavioral control), FOMO, mass media cover­
age, relative advantage, and perceived risk. Three differ­
ent models for the Digital Yuan, Digital Korean Won, and
Digital US Dollar are presented.

Methods
Data collection and sample characteristics
An online survey was used for this study, which was
distributed to potential participants through profes­
sional organizations in China, South Korea, and the
United States by sending a link to a randomized ques­
tionnaire from August to September 2021. The begin­
ning of the questionnaire clarified the elements and
objectives of this research. Each participant took 10–
15 minutes to complete the questionnaire. A total of
897 valid responses were collected in China, South

Measures for study variables
The survey contained a mix of multi-item and one
dual-item measure. Scale items to assess the study
variables were adopted from validated measurement
items in the previous studies and from the current

JOURNAL OF TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETING

literature and were anchored on a 7-point Likert-type
scale. Attitude toward CBDC payments and perceived
behavioral control were adopted from Han et al.’s
(2020) scale, behavioral intention was adopted from
M. Kim’s (2021) scale, while subjective norm was
adopted from Venkatesh et al.’s (2012) scale. Mass
media coverage construct with its two measurement
items was adopted from the Juschten et al.’s (2019)
scale. Despite the fact that in confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA), it is advisable to have at least three
items per factor; scales with more than one factor
may be identified with as few as two items per factor
(Meredith, 1993; Raubenheimer, 2004). Thus, con­
structs that are narrowly defined (such as “mass
media coverage” in the case of our study), growing
evidence suggests that even single-item measures
may suffice (Bergkvist & Rossiter, 2007; Wang et al.,
2019). The FOMO construct was adopted and
adjusted from the Reinecke et al.’s (2017) scale, rela­
tive advantages construct was adopted from the
Oturakci and Yuregir (2018) and Zolkepli and
Kamarulzaman (2015) scales, while perceived risk con­
struct was adopted from the Featherman and Pavlou
(2003) scale. The common method bias of selfadministrated questionnaires was minimized by fol­
lowing the methods of Podsakoff et al. (2003), while
the method of Terglav et al. (2016) was used to avoid
the replication of the hypothesis structure. Explicitly,
the following procedural strategies were used to
minimize the common method bias: participants
were well informed in regards of research purpose
and how will research results be used, survey per se
was not extensive, measurements were not overlap­
ping, questions were clear without ambiguities,
7-point and 5-point Likert-type scales were used to
minimize the scale properties, wording of the items
was balanced carefully, and measures were adopted
from different sources.

Results
Data quality testing with CFA
This study followed Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988)
two-step approach, using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 26.0
for analysis. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was
first conducted for each measurement item to build
a measurement model. This was followed by con­
structing a structural equation model from measure­
ment results to assess the model fit. Finally, we
performed a multigroup analysis to evaluate the
differences that exist between countries. As shown
in Table 2 and Figure 2, the goodness-of-fit indices

159

for all samples (Digital Yuan: GFI = .909, IFI = .961,
TLI = .954, CFI = .961, RMSEA = .044; Digital Korean
Won: GFI = .919, IFI = .955, TLI = .946, CFI = .955,
RMSEA = .056; Digital US Dollar: GFI = . 861,
IFI = .899, TLI = .886, CFI = .899, RMSEA = .081)
and factor loading values between .576 and .949
(p < 0.01), these indicators presented with relatively
positive outcomes. In addition, the composite relia­
bility (CR) for each factor reached above the recom­
mended value of .600 (range .648 to .949) and the
average variance extracted (AVE) was greater than
the recommended metric of .500 (range .501 to .861;
Hair et al., 2017). The internal consistency of all
measurements was demonstrated, along with suffi­
cient convergence. Furthermore, Table 1 illustrates
the mean and standard deviation of each construct,
as well as the correlation between the constructs.

Structural model evaluation and hypotheses testing
A structural model was generated and analyzed by
AMOS 26.0, and hypotheses were tested for relation­
ships (see, Table 3). The results showed that the
goodness-of-fit
statistics
of
model
(DY:
χ2 = 701.755, df = 314, p < .001, χ2/df = 2.235,
GFI = .883, CFI = .934, IFI = .935, TLI = .927,
RMSEA = .056; DW: χ2 = 1020.260, df = 312,
p < .001, χ2/df = 3.270, GFI = .853, CFI = .915,
IFI = .915, TLI = .904, RMSEA = .073; χ2 = 1060.098,
df = 316, p < .001, χ2/df = 3.355, GFI = .813,
CFI = .879, IFI = .881, TLI = . 875, RMSEA = .078) all
reached an excellent level. Meanwhile, with the total
variance of three digital currencies on behavioral
intentions amounting to 69%, 60.8%, and 65.8%,
respectively, the model was also concluded to have
a satisfactory level of predictability for behavioral
intentions. Additionally, the variance explained by
attitudes (DY:R2 = .365; DW:R2 = .585; DU:R2 = .417)
and subjective norm (DY:R2 = .008; DW:R2 = .029;
DU:R2 = .561) was also obtained. In addition, the
relationship between the variables of the TPB
model, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control
on behavioral intention for the Digital Yuan
(ATT>BI: β = .460, p < .01; PBC>BI: β = .441,
p < .05) and Digital Korean Won (ATT>BI: β = .420,
p < .01; PBC>BI: β = .394, p < . 01) were significantly
related. Subjective norms and behavioral intention
had a significant association for the Digital Korean
Won (β = .159, p < .01), and the Digital Yuan
(β = −.330, p > .05) showed with no significant
effect. Moreover, the Digital US Dollar revealed no
significance in each relationship of the TPB model
(ATT>BI: β = .073, p > .05; SN>BI: β = .088, p > .05;

PBC>BI β = .026, p > .05). Thus, Hypotheses 1a, 1b,
2b, 3a, and 3b were supported, whereas Hypotheses
1c, 2a, 2c, and 3c were not supported. The results
showed a significant effect of mass media coverage
on attitudes for the Digital Yuan (β = .569, p < .01),
Digital Korean Won (β = .765, p < .01), and Digital
US Dollar (β = .615, p < .01). Therefore, Hypotheses
4a, 4b, and 4c were supported. And by testing the
relationship between the effect of FOMO on attitude
(DY: β = .202, p < .01; DW: β = −.006, p > .05; DU:
β = .194, p < .05) and subjective norm (DY: β = .089,
p < .05; DW: β = .170, p < .01; DU: β = .749, p < .01).
We concluded that Hypotheses 5a, 5c, 6a, 6b, and 6c
are supported, while Hypothesis 5b is not supported.
Not only that, while exploring the impact of relative
advantaged (DY: β = .516, p < .01; DW: β = .174,
p < .01; DU: β = .230, p < .05) and perceived risk
(DY: β = −.113, p < .05; DW: β = −.023, p > .05; DU:
β = .092, p > .05) on behavioral intention, we iden­
tified Hypotheses 7a, 7b, 7c, and Hypothesis 8a as
being supported, but Hypotheses 8b and 8c were
not supported.

Evaluation of indirect and direct effect
The indirect effect from the generated structural model was
analyzed. The findings presented a significant indirect
effect in the relationship between mass media coverage –
attitude – behavioral intention for the Digital Yuan (β = .262,
p < .01) and Digital Korean Won (β = .321, p < .01). In
contrast, only a significant effect between FOMO-attitudebehavioral intention was evidenced by the Digital Yuan
(β = .093, p < .01). In addition, the results of testing the
indirect effect between FOMO-subjective norm-behavioral
intention revealed a meaningful indirect effect for the
Digital Korean Won (β = .027, p < .01) and Digital US
Dollar (β = .066, p < .01). Subsequently, total effect on
behavioral intention were assessed through a structural
model constructed with data from China (βATT = .460**,
βSN = −.330, βPBC = .441*, βMM = .262**, βFM = .063, βRA
= .516**, βPR = −.113*), South Korea (βATT = .420**, βSN
= .159**, βPBC = .394**, βMM = .321*, βFM = .025**, βRA
= .174**, βPR = −.023), and the United States (βATT = .073,
βSN = .088, βPBC = .026, βMM = .287**, βFM = .238**, βRA
= .230**, βPR = .092) (see, Table 4).

Assessment of multi-group moderating effect by
comparing chi-square differences
In order to investigate the invariance of the three different
digital currencies, we integrated the three groups of data
into a full sample consisting of 897 samples (containing 323
from China, 317 from Korea and 257 from the US) and
performed an invariance test. A baseline model and
a nested model were determined by maintaining the
same structural model and constraining the same paths
to observe differences in chi-square values (see, Table 5
and Figure 3). The results of invariance tests indicated that
there was a significant difference in all paths except in the
relationship between mass media coverage and attitude

(Δχ2[2] = .891, p > .05), which was not significant. That is,
there were statistically significant differences between atti­
tude and behavioral intention (Δχ2[2] = 23.700, p < .01),
subjective norm and behavioral intention (Δχ2[2] = 18.401,
p < .01), perceived behavioral control and behavioral inten­
tion (Δχ2[2] = 58.903, p < .01), FOMO and attitude
(Δχ2[2] = 7.550, p < .01), FOMO and subjective norm
(Δχ2[2] = 40.289, p < .01), relative advantaged and beha­
vioral intention (Δχ2[2] = 19.294, p < .01), as well as per­
ceived risk and behavioral intention (Δχ2[2] = 14.788,
p < .01). Hence, Hypotheses 9a, 9b, 9c, 9e, 9 f, 9 g, and 9 h
were supported, whereas Hypothesis 9d was not supported.

Discussion and implications
International tourists behavioral intention toward adop­
tion of CBDCs as a payment method model developed
on extended psychological framework of TPB managed
to make an important contribution to the understanding
of the underlying mechanism that could resolve many
issues in the evolving digital landscape. As seen in
Figure 2 there are important differences in international
tourists’ behavioral intention toward adoption of CBDCs
as payment method between the Digital Yuan, Digital
Korean Won, and Digital US Dollar. Furthermore, Figure 3
demonstrated the moderating role of the Digital Yuan,
Digital Korean Won, and Digital US Dollar in all paths
within conceptual model except in the relationship
between mass media coverage and attitude.
In this study, the relationship between the variables of
the TPB model within the Digital US Dollar was not sig­
nificant. These results are directly related to the current
digital landscape within the U.S., where there is no reg­
ulatory clarity for the digital assets. Gary Gensler, the chair

of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is
spreading uncertainty with his ambiguous statements,
and he is not providing clarity for the digital assets market.
This is supported by statements of SEC commissioners
Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman, who argue that there is
no clarity on regulations related to the digital assets and
clarity is a key point when applying legal principles
(Gorman, 2021). Moreover, SEC Commissioner, Hester
Peirce claims that the application of the investment con­
tract test of SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (328 U.S. 293, (328 U.S.
293, 1946)) does not work well for digital assets, due to
the nature of digital assets, which is not the same as
physical assets (Kiderlin, 2021). The effect of perceived
risk on behavioral intention toward adoption of the
Digital US Dollar was insignificant due to lack of clarity
on digital assets and the ambiguity of the FED’s approach
toward the inception of the Digital US Dollar. This is
supported by recent interviews in which Jerome Powell,
Chairman of FED, has expressed certain openness toward
CBDC, while Vice Chair of the FED, Mr. Randal Quarles, has

existing laws related to the transfer of value and modifica­
tions of existing regulatory frameworks (Myszkowska,
2021). Furthermore, some users worry that CBDCs issued
on blockchain based on a hybrid approach, as such block­
chain would permit government authorities to trace their
transactions. Indeed, the Asian Development Bank (2021)
outlines that CBDCs based on hybrid approach allow
authorities to track down substantial-value settlements;
however, it also offers authorities a powerful instrument
in the detection of substantial-value settlements that are
related to illegal activities, such as tax evasion, money
laundering, fraud, terrorist financing, drug-smuggling,
and many other illegal activities. Certain perceived risks
related to CBDCs are related to an important characteristic
of blockchain, which is irreversibility. While irreversibility
offers credibility, it certainly sanctions all mistakes made
by humans during value transactions on blockchain
(Banyal et al., 2020). Finally, the positive effect of FOMO
on subjective norms and attitudes toward the Digital US
Dollar and the relative advantageous effect of behavioral
intention toward adoption of the Digital US Dollar,
appears overpowering, as the benefits of CBDC payments
could improve the financial conditions of its users. This is
supported by Cox (2021b) as U.S. consumers are embra­
cing the entirely online payment landscape.
The relationship between the variables of the TPB
model within the Digital Yuan was positive between
the attitudes and perceived behavioral control on

subjective norm. The relative advantage and per­
ceived risk had positive and significant effect on
behavioral intention for the Digital Yuan. These
results are under the direct influence of the
Chinese government, which is creating clear regula­
tions and supports an underlying mechanism for
successful inception of its CBDC. Furthermore,
Redman (2021) points out that the Chinese govern­
ment is forcing McDonald’s, Visa, Nike to accept
payments in Digital Yuan. At the same time, the
PBoC has declared that cryptocurrency-related busi­
nesses is illegal and that cryptocurrency transactions
originating outside China will be treated as crimes
(Jennings, 2021).
The results of this study show that the relationship
between the variables of the TPB model within the
Digital Korean Won were positive and significant. It
appears that South Koreans recognize the implications
of CBDC and benefits related to the efficient and
advanced payment systems coupled with higher finan­
cial inclusion. These results are supported by recent
developments where the BOK has progressed in their
inception of CBDC by choosing DLT (that runs on Klaytn
ledger, based on Ethereum) provided by Ground X (the
blockchain subsidiary of internet giant Kakao) as a basis
for its pilot trials set in December 2021 (Bovaird, 2021).
Furthermore, while the relationship between mass
media coverage and attitude was positive for the
Digital Korean Won, FOMO had a positive and significant
effect only on subjective norm. This is due to the excep­
tional financial literacy among South Korea's population,
strong usage of smartphone apps that offer end-user
digital wallets, and consumers who understand the pro­
cess behind the digital payments based on digital cur­
rency (Seo, 2021). Finally, the relative advantage had
positive and significant effects on behavioral intention
for the Digital Korean Won; however, the perceived risk
effect on behavioral intention was insignificant. These
results are supported by Ledger Insights (2021b) who
outline that the South Korean government and the BOK
have created clear policies and regulations in their
phase-in approach in implementing the Digital
Korean Won.
Finally, the moderating roles of the Digital Yuan,
Digital Korean Won, and Digital US Dollar showed sig­
nificant differences in all paths within conceptual model
except in the relationship between mass media cover­
age and attitude. These results are related to opinion
leaders’ vague and often contradicting comments and
views related to CBDCs. Nevertheless, recently the Group

165

of Seven (G7) agreed on set of public coverage rules for
CBDCs, which will be founded upon transparency, fiscal
management, and an adherence to the rule of law in an
approach created to cultivate innovation and support
for digital currencies for retail purposes (James, 2021).

Theoretical implications
This study offers several valuable theoretical contribu­
tions as its originality reveals the specific relationships
within the behavioral intentions of international tourists
toward the adoption of CBDCs as a payment method.
First, this study attempts to expand the TPB model by
adding the important aspects of digital payments sys­
tem in the context of CBDCs, such as mass media cover­
age based on Katz and Lazarsfelds’ Two-Step Flow
Theory (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955), FOMO as defined by
McGinnis (2020), relative advantages grounded on
Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Rogers, 2003),
and perceived risk built on Bauer’s TPR (Bauer, 1960).
This research suggests that international tourists gener­
ally recognize the benefits of CBDCs; however, it appears
that there is a certain lack of knowledge related to CBDC
technology and a lack of clarity related to the regulatory
framework that safeguards CBDCs. Nevertheless, atti­
tudes toward CBDC payments, subjective norms, and
behavioral control from a psychological perspective
can be significant predictors of international tourists’
behavioral intention to use CBDCs for payments. This
research offers valuable theoretical support to prior
research that employed TPB in predicting consumers’
behavioral intention toward digital asset and digital pay­
ments (M. Kim, 2021).
Moreover, this study proposed antecedents of atti­
tude toward CBDC payments and subjective norms of
international tourists in a new empirical way based on
the current landscape of digital payments. Hence, this
study showed that the attitude toward CBDC payments
is influenced by mass media coverage as transparency of
opinion leaders and clarity in communication related to
important legal and regulatory issues is of paramount
importance. Accordingly, the FOMO effect on attitudes
toward CBDC payments and subjective norm was influ­
enced by the government's determination to be the first
country to issue fully functional CBDC as such a move
would bring them global recognition as being the leader
in innovation of financial technology. Hence, this
research provides theoretical support for a new stand­
point of TPB by suggesting that in the context of digital
payments, mass media coverage, and FOMO are robust
drivers of attitude toward CBDC payments and subjec­
tive norms.

A. RADIC ET AL.

In the scarcity of academic research in the field of
tourism and hospitality related to adoption of CBDCs by
international tourists, this study offers valuable theore­
tical implications as it shows that the relative advantages
and perceived risk have significant effect on interna­
tional tourists’ behavioral intention toward CBDCs.
Furthermore, this study demonstrates that relative
advantages and perceived risk can be successfully inte­
grated into the TPB model in the context of digital
payments. Hence, in accelerating developments in finan­
cial technology and CBDCs, international tourists
acknowledge the importance of cheap, fast, and inclu­
sive digital payments offered by CBDCs. Accordingly,
using digital assets in daily transactions for payments
may be in the early stages (M. Kim, 2021); however, the
relative advantages and perceived risk related to CBDCs
are favorably recognized by international tourists.
As current societies are progressing to cashless socie­
ties, this study offers a valuable theoretical baseline for
future studies on CBDCs and consumer perceptions,
emotions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward
digital payments in international tourism. Moreover,
the extended TPB model of this study offers important
theoretical value as it opens new directions in rapidly
evolving digital payment systems.

Practical implications
The relationship between the variables of the TPB
showed that attitude toward CBDCs payments, sub­
jective norm, and behavioral control are robust and
significant antecedents of international tourists’ beha­
vioral intention toward the adoption of CBDCs. Thus,
government and central bank communication strate­
gies should bring clarity, and governments should
create regulatory frameworks and policies that sup­
port innovation in digital payment systems. However,
despite the fact that approximately 100 countries are
at some phase of exploration and adoption of CBDC,
current legal frameworks in most of those countries
were implemented prior to blockchain revolution
(Soderberg et al., 2022). Thus, in order to be clear,
which is of paramount importance for CBDC’s wide
adoption, many countries will have to make certain
legislative reforms. Countries that have managed to
make the necessary legislative reforms within the
legal framework, clarifying that the central bank has
a mandate to issue CBDC, are the Bahamas, China,
South Korea, Sweden, Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine.
CBDC's efforts in enhancing person-to-person and
cross-border transactions for international tourists
around the world via blockchain technology should
be built on a payment system that will make

payments as easy as email. Furthermore, CBDCs are
capable of improving the speed and reliability of
international transactions. Hence, CBDCs could offer
much attractive cost-effectiveness, which would boost
international tourists’ attitude toward CBDC pay­
ments, subjective norm, and behavioral control.
The results of this study showed the significant
impact of mass media coverage on international tourists’
attitudes toward CBDC payments, that is, mass media
coverage indirectly motivates international tourists’
intention to use CBDCs payments for travel and leisure.
From a managerial perspective, opinion leaders need to
position CBDC usage behavior as a social trend, by pro­
viding the clarity in the regulatory framework.
Furthermore, opinion leaders must be technology neu­
tral and should not hand pick winners and losers
between CBDCs and/or CBDCs and private companyissued digital payment systems. Mixed and contradictory
statements from opinion leaders should be avoided as
such actions are causing a negative effect on attitudes
toward the CBDC and digital payment ecosystem as
a whole.
International tourists experience anxiety and unease
for not utilizing a cheap and fast cross-border payment
system; thus, in this study, FOMO was found to be
a significant driver of international tourists’ attitude
toward CBDC payments and subjective norm.
Accordingly, central banks need to adopt a neutral digi­
tal asset going in/between CBDCs that would serve as
a settlement asset across government jurisdictions
(Bains, 2022). Such a neutral digital asset agreed upon
by central banks should offer privacy for its users, should
be issued on agile multi-platform that provides scalabil­
ity, should be distributed on open-source development
platform so it can meet various regulatory frameworks
and should be supported by a community of developers
who are dedicated to enhancements in pursuit of new
features and committed to essential functionality. These
results are supported by Silva Santos et al. (2021) who
noticed that FOMO affects individuals’ perception that
might be excluded from important events. Finally, the
results of this study showed that FOMO had a negative
effect on attitudes in the Korean Won Group, which can
be explained by various cyberattacks from North Korea
on cryptocurrency exchanges based in South Korea (Y.
Kim, 2017).
The relative advantage and perceived risk of CBDCs
have a significant effect on behavioral intentions toward
the adoption of CBDCs, as CBDCs have valuable features
that provide the fast and cheap payments for interna­
tional tourists. CBDCs with established neutral digital
assets can be the hub that provides fast, secure, and
cheap person-to-person and cross-border transactions

JOURNAL OF TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETING

for international tourists around the world (Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), 2021c). CBDCs might
not solve all payment issues for international tourism
stakeholders, but it will certainly enhance interoperabil­
ity and boost liquidity, so the international tourism sta­
keholders do not have to keep essential funds in various
payment systems. These results are supported by Raza
et al. (2021) who argue that people might positively use
technology if they hold knowledge and awareness of it.

social media, and specialized literatures as it brings
a critical social justice approach and distinctive concepts.
Notwithstanding these limitations, to the authors’ best
knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate
the impact of the inception of CBDCs on international
tourists behavioral intention toward adoption of CBDCs
as a payment method.

Disclosure statement
Limitations and future research
This pioneering study is not without certain limitations,
which in turn, can offer opportunities for future research.
The first is that, because of its focus, the study is based
on particular constructs and Ajzens’ TPB (Ajzen, 1991).
Future studies could include other constructs and con­
cepts compatible with this model. Examples of such
possible constructs and concepts that would be compa­
tible and/or complementary with the model from this
study include but are not limited to innovation charac­
teristics and innovation adoption-implementation
model (Oturakci & Yuregir, 2018; Zolkepli &
Kamarulzaman, 2015), the unified theory of acceptance
and use of technology model (Venkatesh et al., 2003),
the technology acceptance model (Venkatesh & Davis,
2000) and the consumer adoption process model
(Radder, 2003). The second is the use of an online selfadministered survey. Accordingly, special attention
should be employed in generalizing the findings due
to self-response bias. However, for the purpose of this
study, the authors have designed a survey following the
suggestion outlined by Podsakoff et al. (2003).
Subsequently, the issue with replicating the structure
of the hypotheses was lessened by mitigating the selfresponse bias between independent and dependent
variables. Furthermore, future studies should employ
a field survey method to overcome the aforementioned
limitations. The third limitation is the study design,
which was cross-sectional. Thus, as Carlson and
Morrison (2009) argue in such studies, the time-related
correlation between exposure and outcome is missing.
Future studies could employ a longitudinal study design
to overcome this limitation of the present study. The
fourth limitation is that this study involved participants
who were international tourists with skills and access to
use the Internet. Hence, future studies should include
international tourists who do not have the skills to use
the Internet or who do not have access to it. The fifth
limitation is the research approach, which in this study
was situational analysis. Nevertheless, Clarke (2021) out­
lines a situational analysis approach that allows usage of
data narrative and historical materials from websites,

No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).
