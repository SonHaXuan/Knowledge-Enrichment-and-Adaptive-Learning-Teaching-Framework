The banking and financial landscapes have been inundated with technology over the last decade, with FinTech, InsurTech and RegTech being
just some of its new applications in finance. Global Perspectives in FinTech:
Law, Finance and Technology helps readers in clarifying key terms that
have emerged in the vivid field of FinTech. It links keywords, from law
and regulations, to finance and technology.
This book highlights the idea of understanding different disciplines in
FinTech. It commences with introducing readers to the fundamentals of
FinTech and the importance of regulation. It emphasises the importance
of privacy issues and criminal activities caused by new forms of finance
driven by FinTech. The book delives into understanding regulatory innovation with the aim of providing best practices and lessons learned from
countries across the world. It advances with digital assets in FinTech and
ends with financial inclusion where Fintech can contribute to building a
better society.
This edited volume distinguishes itself by focusing on the academic
works of scholars with a different area of specialisation in the FinTech
field, including technology, innovation and regulation. A practical
compendium that explains concepts and follows through on applications
in FinTech, including its challenges and evolving nature, this book will

Foreword by Bryan Zheng Zhang

The increasing adoption of technology in financial services has enabled
the emergence of new financial instruments, channels, assets and systems
in the last decade, blurred the lines of institutional arrangements and challenged the existing regulatory and policy boundaries. Global Perspectives
in FinTech: Law, Finance and Technology is therefore a timely publication,
contributing to academic literature and furthering our understanding of
Fintech and its business, legal and regulatory implications. This book
provides a comprehensive and multidisciplinary analysis of FinTech from
various perspective, at both global and regional levels. It covered important topics such as FinTech regulation, data privacy and protection,
financial crimes, regulatory innovation, regulatory issues surrounding
digital assets and policy considerations for financial inclusion.
Fintech has never been purely about technological advancement, or the
development of tech-enabled innovative business models, but it needs to
be understood in a socio-economic as well as a political-cultural context.
With rapid growth across almost all Fintech verticals in the last few years,
especially during the global pandemic, issues such as consumer protection, financial stability, data privacy, cybersecurity and financial inclusion
become increasingly pertinent for regulators and policymakers to consider
around the world. With a flurry of new entrants to the market, including
financial incumbents and BigTechs, and a wide array of new activities and
business models, we need to research more urgently and critically about
the legal, regulatory and policy implications of digital financial services,

especially in relation to the millions of consumers and SMEs that they
are serving on a daily basis. This book makes a positive step in that
research direction, and I hope readers from across disciplines will find
it informative and useful
On a personal level, I have had the pleasure in working with all three
editors Hung-Yi, Pawee and Nafis through the collective work that we
have done at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School in the last few years. This book
is a great example and indeed a fruit of academic collaboration that I hope
may long continue and thrive.

Foreword by David Donald

Finance has been tied to available technology since the Mesopotamians
first used stone engraving to memorialise debt obligations; millennia
later, the Rothschilds perfected communications within their European
network of carrier pigeons to anticipate market developments and Scottish
Widows applied statistical analysis of data to create a pension fund. Today,
however, the process has taken a quantum leap: enormous quantities of
data come together at high speed to be processed by artificially intelligent
systems with precision human thought cannot match. This concentration
of data and processing power applied to finance has thus earned its own
the name – “FinTech”.
The resulting, radical changes in market operation are occurring within
an ideological context in which powerful private actors aspire to replace
traditional prerogatives of government by introducing private cryptocurrency and stablecoin to supplement or even replace fiat currencies.
The issues of market integrity, consumer protection and data privacy
that arise within this explosive context are of course many, and pressing.
Global Perspectives in FinTech: Law, Finance and Technology offers
insightful analysis of the major market innovations and the regulatory
challenges, as well as a look at the future private challengers to central
bank currency.
Although FinTech has been widely discussed for many years, the
academic literature on its nature and regulatory challenge is still incomplete. Global Perspectives in FinTech presents useful conceptual modelling

of the legal challenges of FinTech, detailing its innovative achievements,
their regulation, data privacy risks, potential and novel forms of crime, as
well as opportunities for financial inclusion.
Global Perspectives in FinTech lives up to its name by providing expert
analysis of many jurisdictions leading FinTech innovation in Asia and
Europe. We can expect this book to become essential reading for students
seeking to understand the future of finance, and also expect the book
to be found on the bookshelves of market participants, financial lawyers,
regulators and policymakers.

Introduction
FinTech is an emerging field, and most of the existing literature appears
in the form of industry reports, consulting reports, working papers and
policy recommendations. Although the FinTech subject has been widely
discussed for many years, there is a lack of literature on some categorizations of FinTech. It is evident that technological innovations in
financial services are increasingly transforming the way financial services

are provided and used by consumers. This transformation varies across
the globe and brings the way FinTech is being understood, applied and
regulated in different jurisdictions. Globally, FinTech has opened up new
and innovative opportunities for the financial services industry but, at
the same time, has been engulfed with potential risks to consumers and
investors and, more broadly, to financial stability. Thus, it is important to
understand the global perspectives in FinTech with a focus on technology,
innovation and regulation.
Many countries are trying to develop regulatory instruments in
response to financial technologies (FinTech). Specifically, proper regulatory instruments for FinTech are needed to strike a balance between
market simulation and risk management. This can lead to the use of new
technologies in finance in many ways, such as digital finance to enhance
financial inclusion in developing countries. However, in terms of law,
finance and technology, it is still challenging for all stakeholders, including
regulators, to identify a proper regulatory approach to achieve the goal as
mentioned above in a sustainable way.
Globally, there are lessons learned from many countries across the
globe in the past many years in terms of regulatory responses for FinTech.
It is widely accepted that strict regulation can result in overregulation
problems that impede innovation and competition. In the meantime,
unregulated businesses can mitigate consumers’ risks.
It is important to explore various aspects of FinTech, the legislative
efforts of countries and its relation to technological development. This is
necessary to demonstrate different levels of regulatory frameworks in relation to certain categories of FinTech businesses. In particular, it will be
interesting to observe how regulatory innovations such as a regulatory
sandbox initiative and innovation offices, along with other supporting
initiatives are pushing FinTech growth in certain jurisdictions.
Nowadays, it can be seen that regulators are receptive to fast-growing
technologies such as FinTech; however, they continue to face difficulties in supervising and regulating FinTech businesses due to a number
of factors. For instance, the lack of understanding of the technologies
presents regulators with difficulties in regulating such businesses. On the
other hand, resource insufficiencies with respect to staff, expertise and
tools are key concerns amongst regulators. In other words, regulators
across the globe are actively responding to fast-growing technologies,
including those that are being used in the financial sector. While FinTechrelated regulations have only recently been developed in a number of

1

jurisdictions and regulators in many jurisdictions are still attempting to
balance the above-mentioned FinTech regulatory goals, new innovative
regulatory tools such as the regulatory sandbox, innovation offices and
Regulatory Technology (RegTech) have the potential to be tools for
regulators in implementing and drafting suitable regulations for such
technologies.
In terms of regulatory responses, to design proper regulatory framework for FinTech is challenging. This is also because the restrictions must
be specified by each regulator depending on different local contexts;
for example, in Singapore, the country ranked as the most innovative
according to the innovation index1 and outlined various options for its
regulatory sandbox, in particular a normal sandbox and express sandbox
to support different kinds of innovations.2
To overview, for the FinTech regulatory framework, the following
issues should be included in such regulations—qualifications of digital
financial services businesses (market entry) and requirements or restrictions to prevent operational risks and to protect consumers and other
stakeholders involved. All requirements and restrictions need not overregulate such platforms, as they may possibly impede the utilization
of innovations. However, the situation may be different in a country
which had a well-established regulatory framework and supervisory mechanism such as Singapore. Non-binding guidance could be more proper to
provide clarity in this case. To this, this book presents regulatory analysis
of various FinTech sectors that consist of different challenges and its stage
of development.
In terms of the advantages of FinTech, FinTech is promising to be
utilized in many ways due to a variety of factors, including the number of
internet users, social users and mobile subscriptions. These statistics are
significant in terms of the use of digital finance to expand access to financial services. However, again, financial technology is a fast-growing area
of innovation, and its characteristics have led to difficulties for regulators

in identifying a suitable regulatory approach. For example, to demonstrate the general benefit of FinTech, FinTech can be used to enhance
access to finance for households and to strengthen the capacity of SMEs
in accessing it. First, FinTech can increase the institutional innovation
capacity of traditional banks and/or financial institutions. Second, it
can provide alternative sources of funding through innovative channels.
Third, FinTech can enhance access to credit by making use of alternative
sources of data. Also, as an indirect consequence of FinTech development,
FinTech also has promise in non-urban areas, the economic development
of which rely heavily on local products or small and medium enterprises.
Globally, the success of many countries such as China and India in
the use of digital financial inclusion3 reflects the promising use of digital
or alternative finance in ASEAN countries. However, there are many
regulatory difficulties in adopting digital finance as a tool to solve financial exclusion problems in emerging economies. In particular, the most
significant difficulty would be the lack of regulatory support and/or
the overregulation of digital finance-related businesses. This can reflect
corelation between law, finance, and the way to utilize technologies.
Accordingly, it is significant to explore challenges in FinTech field.
Basically, it is still challenging for regulators, especially in developing
countries, to make laws that can keep pace with fast-growing technologies in particular in financial sectors. Such fast-growing technologies
include various types of technologies utilized in many industries. The
most notable example may be the challenge regulators have faced in regulating blockchain technology due to the technology’s inherent features.
These include its decentralized nature, which means that regulations
cannot focus on any specific points, as in centralized cases.4
Experience from other countries should also be taken into consideration for developing such digital ecosystems at the domestic level for local
enterprises and all stakeholders in general. However, lessons learned at the
domestic level also demonstrate the failure of the adaptation of foreign
legislations that are not applicable in the context of some other countries.

Global Perspectives in FinTech: Specific Issues
The emergence of Financial Technology (FinTech) startups has created a
new breed of financial services providers. The rapid adoption of digital
platforms, Neobanks and investment in digital assets has forced regulators to go beyond traditional regulatory and supervisory guidelines.
Some big FinTech startups are now not too small to be ignored and if
not regulated well can create challenges for financial stability. This issue
has been captured in Chapter 2 which explores the risk emerging from
FinTech and how it can impact financial stability. In addition the chapter
also provides commentary on the recent regulatory responses to FinTech
across different jurisdictions.
FinTech is all about the processing of information about customers
and its analyses. The cross-border transfer of personal data by FinTech
companies raises many issues concerning the regulation of data privacy.
Currently there are not any internationally adopted standards for data
protection. Chapter 3 on privacy, data protection and public interest
considerations for FinTech presents problems concerning the lack of
universal data protection standards globally. FinTech businesses’ crossborder transfers of personal data create a slew of concerns about data
privacy laws. On the one hand, it is critical to protect consumers’ privacy,
yet anonymity may jeopardize the public’s interest. This chapter also
examines the issues posed by FinTech in terms of data privacy laws based
on comparative research. It’s concluded that a model for an international
legislative framework on data privacy is required. It has the potential to
coordinate government methods and standardize FinTech policy.
In the digital age, financial crime against banks and other financial
services institutions are accelerating rapidly. In 2021, global online fraud
attack rates grew by a staggering 223%.5 Chapter 4, Financial Crimes in
the Age of the Digital Economy and FinTech, analyses financial crimes in
the age of the digital economy and FinTech, briefly explaining different
types of financial crimes, such as money laundering, tax evasion, financial fraud or dishonesty, cybercrime in finance, terrorist financing, bribery
and corruption. More specifically, this chapter also provides an illustrative scenario of the detection of financial crimes through the detection
of cross-border transaction-based tax evasion on social media platforms.
Through an instructive example in the shape of a Regtech tool, this

chapter tries to shed light on this darker side of FinTech. It aims to unpick
the complexity of how to harness the potential of FinTech.
FinTech innovations have led to a more mainstream presence
prompting the regulators to explore suitable regulatory environments.
Covid-19 has also increased the overdependence on FinTech solutions
which prompted to more regulatory innovations. A study conducted by
the World Bank and CCAF in 2020 indicated that during the COVID-19
pandemic “The majority of respondent regulators have either accelerated
existing regulatory innovation initiatives or introduced new initiatives.
For example, 72% of respondents have either accelerated or introduced
initiatives on digital infrastructure, 58% have either accelerated or introduced initiatives regarding RegTech/SupTech, and 56% did so in regard
to innovation offices. Regulators from emerging market and developing
economies are more likely to have developed new initiatives or accelerated planned initiatives. […] in light of Covid-19”.6 This sentiment
on regulatory innovation has been captured in Chapter 5, Regulatory
Innovation in FinTech, where the author reviews the existing theories
and academic discussion and better options for FinTech governance.
The chapter provides a matrix to map out four types of regulatory
approaches based on case studies across jurisdictions, spanning various
mechanisms, which includes regulation, innovation offices, regulatory
sandboxes, industry associations, credit ratings agencies and governmentlinked accelerators. How these different mechanisms operate in theory
and practice is the subject of this comparative analysis.
The limited usage of cash and the popularity of cryptocurrency has led
to many governments considering the digital form of money, leading to
the birth of the Central bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Over 90 central
banks7 globally are exploring CBDCs with countries such as Nigeria (eNaira) and East Caribbean countries that have already launched CBDCs,
while a majority of the developed and emerging markets are either in
pilot or research and development phase. Chapter 6, Sovereignty and
Cryptocurrencies: Towards Central Bank Digital Currency, explores the
regulatory and legal responses to the rise of cryptocurrencies. The chapter
provides a comparative overview before delving into some of the major

technical factors that underpin cryptocurrencies and their marketplaces.
With the goal of determining if and how cryptocurrencies will be able
to undermine the traditional notion of a state’s monetary sovereignty.
From this vantage point, the chapter examines the potential and actual
provisions of the CBDCs and their regulation via a comparative lens.
The chapter also discusses and contrasts various private, public and
hybrid efforts throughout the world, despite its concentration on the EU
framework.
The varied features of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins from security to
non-security tokens can lead to complexity from a regulatory standpoint.
Keeping this in perspective, Chapter 7 tries to differentiate “crypto assets”
from “digital assets” in the blockchain ecosystem. The varied features of
digital assets, from security to non-security tokens, lead to complexities
from a regulatory standpoint. A token’s legal status depends on its main
function or the type of token being considered; accordingly, the tokens’
categories are helpful for capturing the complexities of digital assets and
for guiding effective regulatory responses. The complexity of the structure
of digital assets has led to concerns from regulators and all relevant stakeholders, such as consumer risk and money laundering concerns. It aims
to catalogue the main types of crypto assets in the market as is necessary
for the regulatory analysis.
FinTech innovations are also revolutionizing the finance industry
and yielding significant benefits on underserved populations and thus
increasing the financial inclusion. It is overwhelming to see that FinTech is
helping to make financial services accessible to populations who were left
from the traditional financial services system. In this regard, Chapter 8
delves into the intricacies of the debates around FinTech for financial
inclusion and outlines some of the main issues affecting practitioners and
policymakers today. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of
the causes and consequences of financial exclusion. It also outlines the
FinTech opportunity by illustrating how FinTech introduces a new toolkit
for addressing these intractable problems and how it enables approaches
that had previously not been at our disposal. Three success stories are
included to illustrate how FinTech for financial inclusion is making an
impact in markets as diverse as Kenya, China and Scotland.

Conclusion
It can be seen from above that the FinTech landscape is evolving at a rapid
pace due to rapid transformations. These transformations are impacting
the technology behind FinTech, the application of these technologies on
the financial services industry and the overall legal environment of the
FinTech ecosystem. The rich field of FinTech has thus far lacked a holistic
and concerted scholarly focus on comparative and global perspectives.
This work offers new inroads into the global and comparative streams
within FinTech by presenting emerging frameworks and approaches to
topics ranging from privacy and cryptocurrency to innovative regulation
and financial mathematics. The volume brings together a group of international FinTech scholars to highlight emergent global, interdisciplinary
perspectives within the field of FinTech, particularly as they have importance for comparative legal analysis. The book aims to present a timely
addition to the literature given the urgent FinTech issues that continue
to surface in an age of rapid globalization.

FinTech Regulation—A Key to Financial
Stability
Nafis Alam

Introduction
The financial system is experiencing a rapid transformation thanks to the
incorporation of new technologies, the rise of startups, and the heightened interest of the big technology (BigTech) firms in the financial
sector. Even though the technological advancement and introduction of
new players are driving the growth of financial services, it also brings
some never seen risks and intensifies some of the existing risks. This
creates many challenges for the regulators to manage the risks entailed by
FinTech. FinTech can pose risks to the consumers who are using products
and services originating from FinTech startups to the firms themselves
who are part of the FinTech ecosystem and the overall financial stability
of the country where they are incorporated. When it comes to the regulators and policymakers, even though consumers and FinTech firms will be
equally important to them, financial stability is the key focus within their

regulatory perimeter. To set the direction of the chapter, the next section
will talk about the risks posed by FinTechs, with a particular emphasis
on the risk to financial stability. The chapter will then focus on the key
regulatory approaches to safeguard financial stability in the major jurisdictions. The chapter will also outline how the regulators can be well
prepared to overcome any anomalies arising from FinTech, which can
threaten financial stability.

FinTech Risk
As per the report of KPMG,1 regulators have identified risks arising from
FinTech-related drivers, namely the increased dependence of financial
services firms on technology and the growing interconnectedness within
the financial sector, leading to a greater concentration of similar technology solutions within the financial sector. Most Financial Institutions
(FIs) are overly dependent on technology solutions to automate their
activities. Usage of technology such as machine learning, blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and Robo advisory is mainly used for
automation and strategic decision-making with limited human intervention. On one side, this brings cost and process efficiency but can also
make them prone to technology-fuelled biases and misalignment between
technology and business strategies. Due to the interconnectedness of
the financial sector, FinTech as a Service (FaaS) is gaining prominence
as most FIs will be either outsourcing for FinTech capabilities or using
the same big tech solution providers giving rise to a systemic level of
FinTech-related risk. In case there are vulnerabilities in one tech solution,
it will impact many FIs. FIs’ reliance on third-party providers for critical
technology services must also understand the third party’s resiliency and
recovery capabilities in the event of technology disruption.
FinTech risk can impact the users of FinTech, providers of FinTech and
both, in turn, can affect the overall financial stability of the system. We
will next explain the impact of FinTech risk on each segment.

FINTECH REGULATION—A KEY TO FINANCIAL STABILITY

11

FinTech Risk to Consumers
Although it is anticipated that FinTech should bring convenience and
benefit to the consumers, there are areas of FinTech applications that
can pose a substantial risk to the consumers. The dangers posed by
FinTechs to consumers can be broadly categorized around the loss of
privacy; personal data breach; use of digital channels leading to risks
of fraud and scams; lack of consumer understanding of FinTech products and services; mis-selling of FinTech products; harmful manipulation
of consumer behaviour, financial exclusion of tech knowledge deficient
customers as well as risks emanating from tech firms entering the financial
regulatory space that lack adequate knowledge of the financial ecosystem,
operational effectiveness, and financial stability.
Out of the above FinTech risks, the two most common themes are
either related to cyber fraud or data privacy and data security.
One of the biggest concerns for consumers dealing with FinTech products and transacting through digital means is suffering losses from cyber
fraud. Consumers dealing with FinTech startups may face a heightened
risk of encountering financial losses due to the vulnerability of the platform or technology unreliability or vulnerability. Consumers may be more
vulnerable to cyber fraud when acquiring fintech products than when
accessing financial products through more traditional channels because
interaction with providers is largely or exclusively via digital and remote
means. Platform or other technology malfunctions can have adverse
impacts on consumers ranging from the inconvenience and poor service
to monetary loss and loss of data integrity, the risk of which may be
increased due to heavier reliance on automated processing of transactions.
Customer data is the most important asset of the financial ecosystem as
it is being used extensively by product and service providers. Data privacy
and data security issues may arise from the growing volumes of customer
data, access to and secure storage of these data, and the flows of data
between financial institutions and third-party service providers. In order
for FinTechs to flourish and gain customer trust, data privacy and data
security should be the utmost priority.
In addition to the above, customers are further exposed to the vulnerability of the FinTech platform due to underlying technology unreliability.
In the early days of the startups’ life cycle, due to lack of resources, the
security system can be vulnerable. This can expose consumers to higher
risks of loss and other harm, including third-party fraud. Generally, online

12

N. ALAM

financial services platforms are subject to far higher rates of fraud than are
traditional branch-based financial institutions. Another data-related risk
for consumers arising from FinTech is the usage of customer data by
the platforms. It is evident that the availability of non-traditional data
can bring tremendous benefits to FinTechs, enabling digital lending platforms to authenticate identity and safely underwrite loans to people with
complex credit profiles. However, this identity authentication can also be
misused or abused as FinTech platforms leverage Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in algorithmic analysis to guide business decisions like
targeted marketing and pricing thus putting consumers at the receiving
end.
Risk to FinTech Providers
In the financial services industry, it is a well-known fact that FinTech is one
of the most well-funded and fastest-growing areas. Such is the euphoria
in the market that investors have poured US$91.5 billion into FinTech
firms in 2021, nearly doubling the previous year’s figure and it is expected
that the FinTech market is all set to reach US$324 billion by 2026.2
But, unfortunately, a sad reality is that nine out of ten startups fail and
FinTech 3 startups are not immune to it. In fact, the stakes are much
higher and risks are far greater for FinTech startups.
Apart from the technology risks to the FinTech platforms which is an
apparent risk, many FinTech platforms fail due to a flawed business model
or lack of funding to run a viable startup in a long run. Even though with
a huge amount of investment available, it is true that many platforms fail
to have sustained investment to survive in the long run. For FinTech
startups, to have innovative products and solutions, retain top talent, and
continue to innovate, funds upfront with continuous investments is significant for these startups. Compliance costs and legal aspects of the business
model are also significant risks for FinTechs. FinTech startups need to
stay compliant with their offerings and should be cognizant of knowyour-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering laws, anti-terrorist funding
regulations, and consumer data protection aspects which can augment the
risk of product failure leading to startups failure.

FINTECH REGULATION—A KEY TO FINANCIAL STABILITY

As much as consumers have the cybersecurity risk of using FinTech
services, FinTech platforms are vulnerable to hacks and cyberattacks.
Research by ImmuniWeb has found that 98% of the top 100 global
FinTech startups are vulnerable to major cyberattacks4 including phishing,
app security attacks on mobile and web, etc. Given that FinTech’s
operation is very much investment-driven, many FinTech platforms are
struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of new technologies and, as a
result, are not making the appropriate investments to increase operation’s
efficiency and reduce technology risk attached to their operation.
FinTechs also encounter customer retention risks. Due to competitive
pressures within a given vertical where the customers have a high propensity to switch between providers more easily making it challenging for
the small players to survive in a cut-throat competitive market. In addition, FinTechs also face governance risks. Due to the involvement of the
same group of investors or founders having a huge stake in the platform,
FinTechs also face CEO duality challenges (position, where the CEO is
holding two positions first, holds an office as a CEO and also serves as a
chairman of the board of directors). Most FinTechs fail to disclose corporate governance indicators which can also lead to failures such as Wirecard
bankruptcy.5
FinTech Risk to Financial Stability
It is well established that FinTechs bring cost efficiency and increased
financial inclusion to the financial services industry. But, at the same
time, it can also lead to a greater concentration (perhaps even to the
point of single dominant operators) of some big players in some FinTech
segments, arising from economies of scale in the application of emerging
technologies like Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, etc. There
could be negative financial stability implications from over-dependence on
a limited number of FinTech providers in some markets, the complexity
and opacity of their partnership activities, and potential incentives for risktaking by incumbent financial institutions to preserve profitability (FSB,
2022). In order to understand FinTech’s risk to financial stability, it is
important to define what is financial stability. Financial stability can be

defined as “a condition in which the financial system is not unstable"
which can be due to the instability of either, institutions, market, or infrastructure. Financial stability is an essential requirement not only for price
stability, the policy goal of the central bank but also for the healthy development of the economy. For this chapter, the discussion is focused on
financial institutions (read FinTechs) stability. The stability of financial
institutions refers to a condition in which individual financial institutions
are sound enough to carry out their financial intermediation function
adequately, without assistance from external institutions including the
government.
The emergence of BigTech (refers to the major technology companies
such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, which have
an inordinate influence on the global digital ecosystem) in the financial
system has become prominent in recent times. Big tech firms’ involvement
in finance started with payments, where they have reached a substantial
market share in countries like China (Big Techs like Baidu, Alibaba, and
Tencent). BigTechs are also expanding into other financial services such
as the provision of credit, consumer financing, open banking, crowdfunding, asset management, and insurance among others. A snapshot of
their activities can be seen in Table 2.1.
It can be seen from Table 2.1 that most BigTechs (including new
startups) have ventured into the realm of traditional financial services
and if they are not well regulated they can pose a threat to financial
stability. To get a better insight into how FinTechs (including BigTechs)
can have an implied risk to financial stability, it is important to understand
how FinTechs can create risks to financial stability. Initially, FinTechs can
be too small in size and thus regulators do not see a need to regulate
in the sense that in isolation they might not create systemic risk but
over the period of time can increase risk when carried out the activities
cumulatively, partially due to lack of effective cross-sectoral regulation.
But, over the period, through interconnectedness with incumbents in the
market (banks and other regulated non-banking firms) and/or carrying
out systemically important activities like payments, lending, etc. they can
become too large to ignore and eventually they can create scenarios where
FinTechs and BigTech become “too big to fail”, as shown in Fig. 2.1.
A related risk might also appear in the sense that competition from
BigTech and FinTech entrants may create incentives for incumbent financial institutions to increase risk-taking. For instance, due to competitive
pressure, incumbent banks and insurers could engage in riskier lending or

investment activities to preserve market share and profits.6 In addition to
the financial stability risk emerging out of platforms, even crypto-assets
can pose a threat to global financial stability due to their scale, structural vulnerabilities and increasing interconnectedness with the traditional
financial system.
It can be seen from the above discussion that there are various risks
attached to FinTech impacting customers and platforms themselves but
the biggest concern is the risk to financial stability. It is important for
regulators to continue monitoring the developing risks to consumers,
individual firms, and financial stability, and to intervene accordingly.
This can be done by adopting the existing regulation (and supervision) of the incumbent financial and non-financial firms or by devising
new regulations for FinTechs. In this regard, regulators can introduce
new regulations for consumer protection, cyber security, data privacy,
governance and disclosure frameworks data management as well as the
authorization and regulation of new fintech firms. Regulations also need
to expand to technology forms that are providing financial services or are
an integral part of the financial ecosystem.
Good thing is that regulators across the world are taking the initiative to expand the regulatory perimeter to cover FinTech firms. The
next section will discuss the regulatory measures taken by regulators to
safeguard the FinTech ecosystem.

FinTech Regulation
Regulators are becoming more proactive in the FinTech space in order to
understand the risks and concerns associated with the FinTech industry
and thus the list of regulatory and supervisory responses to FinTechrelated risks continues to increase. Regulation is important for the
financial services industry to have a level playing field for all participants,
to establish an orderly and reliable market to attract customers, and to
provide certainty to market actors as well as a provision to redress any
challenges faced by the stakeholders. Almost all countries across the globe
have some level of FinTech activities and have also established FinTech
enabling regulations. The World Bank Global FinTech-enabling regulations database7 has compiled a list of key regulations across various
FinTech-related activities. This database consists of nearly 200 countries
around the globe primarily to compare and contrast FinTech-related regulations globally. The regulations cover the key areas of Anti-Money Laundering; Equity Crowdfunding; Digital ID; Central Bank Digital Currency
(CBDC); Peer to Peer (P2P) lending; Electronic Money; Customer Due
Diligence (CDD); Cyber Security; Electronic Payment/Transactions;
Cryptocurrency; Data Protection; Innovation facilitators; Cyber security;
Digital Banking; and Open Banking. Table 2.2 highlights regulations in
some key jurisdictions from G20, OECD, and APAC.
It can be seen from the table below that almost every country on
the list has foundational regulations for Anti-Money Laundering and
combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) while the regulations related
to security and transmission of data. In terms of FinTech services,
digital banking and electronic money are the highly regulated ones. It
is disappointing to see that very few countries have issued regulations on
cryptocurrency.

Conclusion
It is proven that FinTechs are now an integral part of the global financial
system. They have reached a substantial market share in payments, digital
currency, alternative finance, etc. in some jurisdictions and are actively
involved in the provision of other financial services worldwide. FinTech

business models are very different from traditional banks and non-banking
entities giving rise to a variety of FinTech-specific risks. Many of these risks
are new to regulators and thus relevant risks are not fully captured by the
regulatory approach up to now. Regulators are taking steps to address
some of the regulatory loopholes and trying to bring FinTechs (including
BigTechs) under the purview of the financial regulatory perimeter. The
key approach to FinTech regulation is to preserve consumer interest and
most importantly have a stable and robust financial system.

Privacy, Data Protection, and Public Interest
Considerations for Fintech
Aleksandr P. Alekseenko

Introduction
The last decade of innovations has become an integral part of the financial industry and has shaped a novel segment of the economy, which is
now referred to as Fintech (a portmanteau of the terms “financial” and
“technology”) (Gai et al, 2018). The positive consequences of the adoption of Fintech are easier access to financial products and services for
a large number of customers, creation of a competitive environment in
the banking and corporate sectors, introduction of digital projects that
contribute to ensuring a stable financial system, a reduction in transaction costs, and fast and efficient payments settlements at the national and
international levels. So today, Fintech provides consumers with opportunities in the sphere of: payments and transfers; asset management;
crowdfunding; peer-to-peer lending; securities trading; online banking;

online accounting; insurance; blockchain and cryptocurrencies (Soloviev,
2018).
Meanwhile, new technologies have caused the appearance of new types
of financial scams which are outside of the traditional fraud detection
approaches and methods, as well as increased perspectives of hacker
attacks because of the vulnerabilities of network systems and web applications. For example, the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Bitstamp and Bitfinex
lost 19,000 and 119,756 Bitcoins, valued at more than US$77 million
because of hacker attacks, and the cryptocurrency Ether, equivalent to
about US$150 million, were stolen from the Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (DAO). Therefore, for developers of novel technologies,
it is necessary to take into account a whole range of risks, including
regulatory risks and data security (Mehrban et al, 2020).
Fintech companies use artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics
to improve authentication, the security of payments, and to enhance
customer communications (Baba et al., 2020) but at the same time, they
collect various consumer data provided directly to the company or even
extracted from the consumer’s web search requests and websites visited.
So, due to the active growth of new services based on the collection
of large amounts of data, the question of data privacy has become a
major concern to Fintech platforms (Hernández et al., 2019), states,
and consumers. Researchers rightly note that, “a growing number of
governmental and private organizations now possess and currently use
data processing in order to determine, predict and influence individual
behavior in all fields of human activity” (Moura & de Vasconcelos, 2020).
Everyone should bear in mind that new financial services are not as easy
as they seem and, of course, are not perfect in many cases. The collection,
storage, and processing of big data raise serious questions not only about
the protection of personal data from hacker attacks, but also from its
usage for uncompetitive and unfair actions by e-commerce and payment
platforms, financial marketplaces, etc. Personal data can be exploited by
Big Tech companies to extract additional economic profits and strengthen
their dominant position in the market (Chirita, 2018). An illustrative

3

example is the case of Alibaba, when this Chinese company settled its
domination of the e-commerce market in China1 and the Google case.2
The concentration of highly sensitive private data in the hands of
Fintech companies and its analysis by machines has far-reaching consequences for individuals. Based on the processed information about race,
gender, sexual orientation, health, financial opportunities, habits, and
even behavior, the computer algorithms may directly or indirectly discriminate and segregate consumers (Cortez, 2020), depriving some persons
from access to financial services. Also, Fintech platforms have technical
opportunities to analyze customers’ web search history and other personal
data, compare its content, and foist targeted advertising or particular
goods toward them. This means that the consumption choice of a client
can be highly dependent on the market policy of the service provider,
i.e., Fintech business has the tools to practice exploitative abuse based on
behavioral economics (Chirita, 2018).
The COVID-19 pandemic has given a strong impetus for new technologies and stressed the question of online business development.
The cross-border character of internet services as well as the novelty
of technologies applied stresses the necessity to shape a legal framework explaining the perspectives of Fintech development. Therefore, this
research aims to examine the rising challenges posed by Fintech for data
privacy, to find grounds for mutually beneficial combination of private
and public interests in this sphere, as well as work out perspectives of
harmonization in the sphere of financial technologies.
The chapter is organized into three sections and a conclusion. It begins
with an analysis of the meaning of sensitive data, describes legal regulations on data privacy, and discusses Fintech’s impact on data privacy.
Following this, the chapter then describes challenges raised by Fintech
for data privacy. After this, theoretical ideas about a legal framework for
Fintech are outlined. The chapter concludes with a proposal to reassess
the role of the state and Fintech companies in the question of providing
privacy protection.

Fintech & Data Protection Regulations
Personal Data and Its Categories
To talk about the challenges concerning data protection raised by Fintech
it is necessary to understand the meaning of personal data. Lundqvist
states that the “definition of personal data is wide since information that
is non-personal might also indirectly, in combination with other information, identify a natural person and become personal data” (Lundqvist,
2018). This is a sound conclusion because even metadata could characterize a person; in particular, a user’s web search may describe consumption habits, health, etc. Consequently, it is very difficult to list all data
characteristics which are sensitive for individuals. Meanwhile, there are
examples of when a legislator has provided a definition of personal data.
According to art. 4 (1) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR)3 that has been in force in the EU since May 2018 and applies to
any Fintech company processing data in the European Economic Area:
personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who
can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

A literal analysis of the GDPR shows that it contains a closed list of data
which is protected, however, commentators have argued that the GDPR
secures the private sphere of a person which includes “any information
stored on a user’s terminal equipment, whether personal or otherwise”
(Kuner et al, 2020). As a result, the GDPR notices guide judges and
companies, and shapes general marks for understanding legally protected
information.
In some states, the meaning of personal data hasn’t been identified.
For example, in Russia, the Federal Law On Personal Data in art. 3 (1)
describes personal data as any information relating directly or indirectly
3 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation), retrieved from: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R0679-20160504&qid=1532348683434.

to a specific or identifiable individual (subject of personal data). Thus,
Russian legislation does not even have an approximate list of personal
data, nor any clear criteria for attributing specific information about a
person to personal data. It could raise questions about the possibility
of attributing certain information about a person to personal data which
is especially important in an environment where digital technologies are
used.
Legal uncertainty concerning the definition of private data in Russia
could stress the question, whether the information received from the
telecom operator allowing direct or indirect identification of the user as
a specific individual is personal data. Courts have decided this issue in
the following way: the data allowing the identification of the subscriber
or their terminal equipment such as surname, first name, patronymic, or
pseudonym of the subscriber-citizen, the subscriber’s address (address
of installation of terminal equipment), subscriber numbers, other data
allowing the identification of the subscriber or his terminal equipment,
data from databases of payment systems for communication services
rendered including connections, traffic, and payments of the subscriber
are considered personal data. This conclusion is from the Award of the
Russian Ninth Arbitration Court of Appeal No 09AP-17574/16,4 where
the court decided that personal information includes the information
transmitted about subscriber’s connections and traffic: cookies in the
user’s HTTP request, which allows distinguishing the user’s traffic from
the traffic of other users to get a list of his or her preferences; the IP
address from the IP packet of the user’s HTTP request, which allows
getting the geographical location of the user with accuracy to the name
of the locality; the user string hash ID, which allows determining the
user hash IDs of subscribers who have expressed disagreement with data
processing.
The recognition by the courts of customer requests, Internet addresses
of web pages visited, IP addresses, etc., which allows identifying the
person as personal data is an important step because it makes it possible to
fill the gap in the legal regulation regarding the specification of data that
relate to general personal data. At the same time, such a broad definition
allows referring to any information as personal data, and as a consequence
obstructs Fintech innovation development.

Personal Data traditionally includes special categories which are altogether called sensitive data. Sensitive data comprises information about
payments, bank cards, and bank accounts; genetic, biometric, and health
information; data about a user’s religion, political, and sexual orientation;
passwords and logins; and other information (Quinn, 2021). In other
words, sensitive data is any information that is not freely available or accessible (Walters, Trakman, & Zeller, 2019) and the illegal use of which may
lead to pricing, political, and other types of discrimination in their daily
life or else cause damage or harm to an individual.
Regulators identify special categories of personal data among sensitive
data. The GDPR settles the legal treatment concerning this in art. 9 (1).
It reads as follows:
Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and
the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely
identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a
natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.

In cases specified in art. 9 (2), prohibitions named in art. 9 (1) are
invalid. Additionally, the GDPR not only introduced legal treatment for
sensitive data, but also defines some of its types: genetic, biometric, and
health data. Notably, in other jurisdictions, there are other special categories of personal data. According to the Federal Law On Personal Data
art. 10 (1) in Russia, they are: data concerning race, nationality, political
views, religious or philosophical beliefs, health status, and intimate life.
In contrast to the GDPR, the Federal Law doesn’t name personal data
concerning trade union membership, sexual orientation, or genetic and
biometric data.
Discrepancy in legal treatments of data is critical for Fintechs. Therefore, it is necessary to elaborate a common vision on the definition of
personal data and its types. On the one hand, the unification or standardization of definitions will facilitate the supervision of cross-border transfer
of data, and on the other hand, Fintech companies will have a clearer path
for their algorithms and services development.

Overview of Data Protection Principles
International Principles of Data Processing
It is consistent with the provisions of a number of universal, regional, and
bilateral international legal acts, including: Council of Europe Convention No. 108 on data protection of January 28, 1981, Convention for the
Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal
Data; European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms of 1950; the Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians during War of 1949. The Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) also issued Guidelines on the
Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data which
established the principles of data processing: collection limitation principle; data quality principle (data shall be relevant, accurate, up-to-date);
purpose specification principle; use limitation principle; security safeguards principle; openness principle; individual participation principle,
consideration of an individual’s right of access and correction.
EU Principles of Data Processing
According to the EU Fintech Action plan, the GDPR is of critical importance for the proper use of innovative data-driven financial services. The
GDRP could be counted as a legal regulation most adapted to modern
conditions and indicative in the field of personal data protection. It has a
direct effect in 28 EU countries and applies to organizations engaged in
professional or commercial activity.
The core question for data protection in the Fintech epoch is how
to regulate data processing and what data processing is. The GDPR in
art. 4 (2) defines processing very broadly. It makes it possible to apply
the GDPR’s data processing provisions to profiling, including the use of
self-learning computer algorithms and technologies of Big Data analysis.
Therefore, the level of data protection in the EU was increased and led to
enforcement actions against companies collecting and transmitting private
data (Houser & Voss, 2018).
Data processing in the EU is only allowed when the user has given
their consent. The consent, according to art. 4 (11) of the GDPR, means
freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data
subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating
to him or her.

32

A. P. ALEKSEENKO

The GDPR in art. 5 establishes the principles of personal data
processing. They are:
– lawfulness, transparency and fairness of such processing in relation
to the subject of personal data (lawfulness is defined in art. 6 of the
GDRP);
– prohibition of further data processing unrelated to the original
purpose of collection;
– data minimization, i.e. adequate, relevant limited purpose of data
processing;
– processing accuracy;
– storage limitation i.e. permission for identification of data subjects
for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the
personal data are processed, except cases indicated in art. 89 (1) of
the GDRP;
– data integrity and confidentiality, i.e. protection against unauthorised
or unlawful processing and against accidental loss.
Named principles formulate the basis for mechanisms of personal data
protection during their collection and processing. Therefore, the GDPR
“might lead to better data management and greater transparency, and
will force organisations to improve their security” (Sydekum, 2018). It
should be noted that the GDPR was adopted not only to optimize the
functioning of the market, but to protect the private interests of personal
data subjects, which in the end can affect the market, while such an impact
is ambiguous and not always positive. So the deletion of information is the
essential right of the data subject. At any time and in any case, the subject
is empowered to withdraw one’s consent to the processing of personal
data and request its deletion from a processor. Taking into account the
fact that the GDPR extends its effect to any controller or data processor,
the compliance with these principles is necessary both within the EU and
outside it, since their violation may entail appropriate liability.
The U.S. Approach
Regulation of personal data storage in processing in the United States
is complicated by a legal system consisting of federal legislation and the
separate legislation of 50 states. There is not a single data protection act in
the United States, therefore foreign Fintechs may be regulated by federal
and state data protection laws (Pittman & Levenberg, 2021). Moreover,

3

PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND PUBLIC INTEREST …

33

the U.S. legislation doesn’t provide unified definitions of personal data,
data processing, controller, and sensitive personal data. However, the lack
of uniform regulation is explained by the fact that personal data is considered as an integral part of the right to personal integrity guaranteed by
the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which is also of interest to
large IT companies registered on their territory (for example, Amazon,
Google, and others).
Brief analyzes of American legislation demonstrate that currently at the
federal level, personal data is regulated by:
–
–
–
–
–

Fair Credit Reporting Act;
Electronic Communications Privacy Act;
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act;
–Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act;
–Financial Services Modernization Act.

The closest to the European data processing standards is the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which equates any digital footprint to
personal data.5 Following the adoption of the law in California; the U.S.
Congress began developing a federal law on the protection of personal
data—the Data Protection Act6 . Also, there are proposals to adopt the
Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act and the United States Consumer
Data Privacy Act.
Thus, it can be argued that in the United States, federal legislation
on the collection of personal data by Fintech companies has not been
formed. Only the State of California has an advanced law regulating this
area. In this regard, if to compare the GDPR adopted in the EU and
America’s experience, it is unlikely that the U.S. approach in regulating
personal data privacy issues is worth relying on.
Russian Data Legislation Overview
In Russia, detailed regulation, concerning the processing of personal data,
is provided by the Federal Law On Personal Data No. 152-FZ dated 27

as any action (operation) or set of actions (operations) performed with
or without the use of automation tools with personal data, including
collection, recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification
(updating, modification), extraction, use, transfer (distribution, provision,
access), depersonalization, blocking, deletion, and destruction of personal
data. Lawful processing of personal data is allowed in the cases listed in
art. Six of the Law On Personal Data under the main condition that the
data subject has given consent.
Also, there are other laws which regulate specific questions of data
processing and transfer. For example, the Federal Law On Experimental Legal Regimes in the Sphere of Digital Innovations in the Russian
Federation introduces exceptions to the rule of individuals’ health data
depersonalization for the purpose of implementing artificial intelligence
technologies in the sphere of medicine. This Law in other aspects mainly
affects telecom operators and Internet companies; therefore, in this
chapter, it won’t be analyzed.
Article 5 of the Federal Law On Personal Data establishes the principles of personal data processing, they are:
– lawful and fair processing of personal data;
– processing of personal data incompatible with the purposes of
personal data collection is not allowed;
– restriction to combine databases containing personal data, the
processing of which is carried out for purposes incompatible with
each other;
– only personal data that meets the purposes of its processing could be
processed;
– content and volume of the processed personal data must correspond
to the stated purposes of processing;
– data accuracy, sufficiency, and if necessary relevance to a person;
– limited period for storage of personal data, after which the processed
personal data shall be deleted or depersonalized.
The listed principles look similar to and don’t contradict those which
are described by the EU’s GDRP. Of course, there are some differences,
for example, the principle of restriction to combine databases, but in
common, they contain the same ideas. This underlines that it is possible

3

PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND PUBLIC INTEREST …

35

to elaborate multilaterally acceptable principles for a future framework for
the regulation of Fintech activities.
Data Subject Rights
Data Subject Rights Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation
The GDPR established clear rules for interaction between users and
companies in the field of Fintech using personal data. This is a tool to
combat manipulation and misuse of personal information and is a significant step in protecting personal information on the Internet. The GDRP
defines the rights of the subject of personal data in detail. Basic rights of
the data subject are:
–
–
–
–
–
–
–

right of access by the data subject (Article 15);
right to rectification (Article 16);
right to erasure or “the right to be forgotten” (Article 17);
right to restrict processing (Article 18);
right to data portability (Article 20);
right to object (Article 21);
right to personally influence automated collection and profiling
systems (Article 22);
– – right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Article
77);
– right to compensation and liability (Article 82).
Thus, the GDRP provides EU resident citizens with the right to
manage personal data: to be aware of the purposes, volumes, and timing
of processing, to request access to it or transfer to another processor, as
well as the requirement to delete it.
Rights of Subject of Personal Data in Russia
The Federal Law On Personal Data in articles 14–17 specifies the rights
of the subject of personal data. They include:
– right of access by the data subject (Article 14);
– right to restrict processing (Article 15);
– right to object to automated data processing (Article 16);

36

A. P. ALEKSEENKO

– right to lodge a complaint against the actions of a data processor
(Article 17).
One more right is ensured in art. 10.3 (1) of the Law On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection—the right
to be forgotten. However, the Federal Law On Personal Data doesn’t
contain a legal provision guaranteeing the right to data portability.
Data Laws Application to Foreign Companies
The GDRP Extraterritorial Application
In order to monitor compliance of national policies with the provisions of
the GDRP, according to articles 51–59 each Member State shall provide
for one or more independent public authorities to be responsible for
monitoring the application of this Regulation. For example, in France this
function is performed by the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et
des Libertés. On December 31, 2021, this public body, based on art. 3 of
the GDPR, fined Google a total of 150 million euros. This case stresses
the importance of the GDRP’s features such as the extraterritorial principle of application of its rules for the processing of personal data, as well
as extraterritorial liability for violations of the rules for the processing of
personal data (art.3).
Russian Concept of Data Localization
One more characteristic feature of the Russian Law On Personal Data
is that it contains a provision forcing data processors to localize their
databases in Russia. The main purpose of the localization requirement
is to protect the public interests of the state. According to art. 18 (5)
the operator must ensure the recording, systematization, accumulation,
storage, processing, and extraction of personal data of Russian citizens
using databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation, except
for cases specified in the Law. Those who don’t want to fulfill the named
requirements will be banned from operating in Russia, as has happened
to the social network LinkedIn. This rule could be a serious obstacle for
foreign Fintech companies, because they must have servers in Russia for
processing the personal data of Russian citizens, or make an agreement
with a data processing center in Russia.

Fintech & Data Protection Challenges
Easy Data Collection
Fintech is mainly based on the analysis of personal information about
the client. For the effective functioning of Fintech, personal data about
customers and their financial transactions are required. Fintech services
strive for inter-product cooperation, which is how they can better satisfy
customer requests, i.e., there may be a need to transfer personal data, and
sometimes financial assets between different applications. It is collected
with the help of the open banking data standard API, which allows third
parties to achieve access to banking information (Boot et al, 2021). In this
manner, banks provide their customers with the opportunity to use convenient and innovative applications for which information on customer
accounts and transactions is transmitted to Fintech companies.
One more source for uncontrolled data extraction is social networks.
They contain information about the surnames of network users, their
place of work or study, place of residence, habits, marital status, geolocation, etc. It is clear that this data was originally provided to the
network during registration by the users themselves. The problem arises
when the personal data of the social network users is used by third
parties (commercial organizations) for their own purposes which have
not received permission for this use of data, neither from users nor from
the social networks, and do not pay for the use of this data. In some
cases, social networks have sued in attempts to secure client information.
Judicial practice in such cases is quite extensive (for example, the Decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 29.01.2018 No.
305-KG17-21,291). According to the position of the courts, personal
data processed by organizations contained in open sources (VKontakte,
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) are not publicly available. Accordingly, it is
necessary to obtain the consent of the data subject to use this information.
The Question of Consent
The person decides themselves which data can be processed, and can at
any moment ask the operator to remove such data from free access. As
constituted in art. 4 (11) of the GDPR, and according to art. 9 of the
Russian Law On Personal Data, the consent shall be freely given, specific,
informed, and unambiguous. A particular consent of the person is not
required if a customer orders goods or services by filling out a questionnaire on the website in an electronic form containing personal data

38

A. P. ALEKSEENKO

information. By submitting their data according to the specified algorithm
for filling out the questionnaire, individuals have actually expressed their
consent to process their personal data. Hence, according to the Russian
legislation, the consent of the subject of personal data is not necessary
for it to be processed if it is carried out within the execution of the
contract. But it is doubtful that consent is freely given, specific, informed,
and unambiguous when a customer uses the default privacy settings of
the application or Internet service, especially if there isn’t any evidence of
attempts to change settings by the user. Herian maintains that users must
voluntarily activate and consent to a smartphone’s applications data policy
and that “the systems will not undermine their privacy by, for example,
using collected data for purposes other than contact tracing” (Herian,
2021). If a customer doesn’t agree with privacy statements, it will be
impossible to use a product.
Of course, sometimes the concept of consent doesn’t work. The
privacy statements could set forth conditions in a way that a person
doesn’t have the opportunity to freely express consent or refuse a transfer
of personal data to third parties or otherwise influence the provisions of
the consent. In this case, a person is forced to give “voluntary” consent,
otherwise the service will be unavailable or the application will not function. It is an enormous problem but, for instance, there are cases when
courts have proclaimed that the terms of a contract, where a consumer
does not have the opportunity to express consent or refuse to process
personal data, are illegal7 .
Users provide access to their data by granting access to it for the
application while choosing permission settings. They believe that services
provided by developers are safe and secure. There are customers who
don’t analyze privacy statements while installing applications. Some of
them validate all application requirements because they are unclear, long,
and written in standardized language texts of privacy statements which
are difficult to understand (Dorfleitner et al, 2021). Most users don’t
ask themselves what data will be collected, by whom and how it will be
processed and to whom it will be forwarded, they just believe the advertisement that investments or payments are easy, install the application,
and enjoy convenient services. The same is true for different e-commerce

2018 No A44-745/2017.

39

platforms. Even news sites collect information by asking you to accept
“cookies.”
Implementation of new techniques for extracting and analyzing large
data underlines the necessity for government supervision to avoid fraudulent actions and ensure the rights of citizens to enjoy privacy (Miglionico,
2019). Also, there is a necessity to reduce financial illiteracy of citizens, and to elaborate an approach where Fintech services will notify
consumers using clear phraseology about all the consequences concerning
data processing. Fintech company clients should know and understand
that investing with the help of new technologies is not just easy, but also
risky for their privacy.
Cybersecurity
Financial applications are one of the most popular targets for cyber attacks
and hacking in order to steal personal information, financial assets, or
commit fraudulent transactions on behalf of the client. For this reason,
participants of financial transactions need confidence that data security is
ensured, and in the Fintech companies’ ability to minimize cyber risks and
protect against cyber threats.
Of course, Fintechs use technologies for data protection, for example,
JWT tokens granting customer authentication, encryption with symmetric
and asymmetric algorithms for cloud-based applications and services
(Bhardwaj & Goundar, 2019), and other types of encryption and
measures for website security, which are also used to address customer
cybersecurity concerns. For example, there is a scheme which protects the
privacy of the customers with the help of attribute-based access control
which means that “only trustable parties are allowed to either partially or
fully decrypt their data” (Mehrban et al, 2020).
However, data leaks are still a real threat to ordinary users, banks,
and Fintech companies. Data leaks are either disclosure of the bank’s
customer data by third parties, or data leakage through computer systems
and various technical means.
The increasing financial damage from the commitment of cyber attacks,
combined with the increasing volume of information data stored in the
network infrastructure, necessitates the development of new services to
ensure information security and data privacy.

40

A. P. ALEKSEENKO

Anonymity & Blockchain
Organizations which collect, record, or store personal information can
ensure data privacy with the help of anonymization and pseudoanymization. The first approach assumes a complete severance of the subject of
personal data with his or her digital footprint. Thus, various companies
are more interested in the second type of data, since they contain parts
of personal data. Nowadays, such a highly valued commodity as customer
data can be easily obtained by “inexpensively using artificial intelligence
and machine learning” (Baba et al., 2020) whenever an internet user
searches a website or purchases goods.
A solution on how to satisfy those customers who value their privacy,
don’t want to share their personal data, and prefer to keep their
anonymity was found with help of blockchain technology. A blockchain
is based on a system which uses a distributed ledger, where multiple
knots together provide authentication. This approach eliminates the need
for intermediaries, clearing and settlement systems, centralized authorities, and third parties as well as ensuring high-security and transparency.
Researchers (Walters et al, 2019) note that:
the technology sector may well argue that new technology (distributed
ledger technology), such as blockchain, or quantum is likely to be safe
as only registered users are able to gain access. Using blockchain as an
example, security begins with the network and the management of the
nodes. At the private level it appears to be the security of verification within
a blockchain system that is most pertinent.

The named features of blockchain make it popular in different industries, including the sphere of finance. On the foundation of blockchain in
2008 a peer-to-peer payment system was launched with a payment unit
named Bitcoin (Chauhan et al, 2022), which is the world’s first cryptocurrency. The developers of Bitcoin use cryptographic methods to ensure
the functioning and protection of the system. Unlike bank accounts and
most other payment systems, Bitcoin addresses are not connected to
the identity of users at the protocol level. Anyone can create a new
randomly generated Bitcoin address at any time without having to provide
anyone with personal information. Everyone can transfer Bitcoins from
one address to any other without having to disclose any personal information. Bitcoin’s transactional information is transmitted by randomly
selected nodes of the P2P network. While Bitcoin nodes connect to each

3

PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND PUBLIC INTEREST …

41

other via IP addresses, the nodes do not know whether the received transaction was created by the node that transmitted the information or just
redirected it.
The introduction of Bitcoin accelerated the process for the development of different services, for example, Dark Wallet, Zerocoin, Darkcoin,
Shared Coin, etc., which proposed technical solutions, such as mixing
of payments, aiming to increase anonymity and to protect personal data.
These blockchain features and technical decisions are in contrast with
know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements. In successful cases, there would be a system allowing untraceable
transactions on the Internet, and of course, impeding the growth of
weapons and narcotics black markets, human trafficking, and illegal activities concerning financing of terrorism and money laundering (Foley,
Karlsen, & Putniņš, 2019). Moreover, the inability to provide identification and verification of the identity of customers engaged in transactions
with cryptocurrencies could undermine a state’s banking systems and
financial stability (Vučinić, 2020).
Thus, utilizing Fintech services as a tool for anonymous financial transactions is a great threat for central governments which are focused on
“data retention, in order to ensure that the data are available for the
purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime”
(Vedaschi & Lubello, 2015). Criminal risks from activities with Bitcoin
could be reduced only by a well-shaped policy toward the supervision
of Bitcoin exchanges, the party’s identity disclosure, and globally recognized approaches concerning cryptocurrency exchange of fiat money and
goods. At the same time, the importance of self-regulation should not
be underestimated. It is technically difficult to control everything in the
blockchain industry, therefore, self-regulation and self-control could be a
good answer for these challenges.
Regulatory Problems
Fintech generates two main tasks for national regulators. The first one is
providing security for storage, transfer, and extraction of private data. The
second one is combating anonymity where it could represent a threat to
public interests. Considering that the Internet is a global network which
could be exploited by Fintech companies to provide services around the
world, the topic of how to strive to reconcile these two controversial
directions is hard to decide. This regulatory difficulty is due to the fact

42

A. P. ALEKSEENKO

that the activity of a Fintech company on data processing could be legitimate in the territorial context of one jurisdiction, but at the same time,
be restricted and sanctioned in another country.
Walters, Trakman, & Zeller (2019) note that individuals and entities have an opportunity to easily relocate all around the world in order
to minimize the impact of particular laws on themselves. This, inturn
exacerbates the data subjects’ ability to manage their data flows and
secure privacy. Cross-border data flows are an important element of
online services (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017), but unfortunately,
there are not any worldwide adopted data exchange security standards in
the Fintech field (Gozman, & Willcocks, 2019). The existing system of
private international law, with its doctrines of choice of applicable law, is
unable to overcome challenges associated with the transborder nature of
data flows (Svantesson, 2011) and Fintech services (Alférez & Fernández,
2020).
As is noted (Moura & de Vasconcelos, 2020):
In a globalized world, in which personal data can instantly circulate and
be used simultaneously in communications networks that are ubiquitous
by nature, these different national and regional approaches are a major
source of conflicts of laws. These, in turn, are also the object of divergent solutions, ranging from the application of data protection rules on a
purely territorial basis to extra-territorial choice of law regimes, according
to which data protection laws may also apply to the processing of personal
data undertaken by entities established outside the jurisdiction of the data
subject’s place of habitual residence.

The private freedoms of data owners are opposed by the public law
interests of localization of personal data, including the interests of national
security. As Bygrave (2014) notes, data privacy law is a sample of regulatory colonization, and this colonization is not only when the data privacy
law is inspiring changes in other legal fields, but also cross-state colonization, where the regulations of one country applies on the territory of
another. In recent years some states have begun to support a policy of
extraterritorial application of their legislation to data flows and to expand
their jurisdictions (Yang, 2021). For example, art. 3 of the GDPR extends
the EU’s standards externally and applies to the processing of personal
data of data subjects who are not in the Union.

3

PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND PUBLIC INTEREST …

43

Therefore, the presence of the EU’s Fintech platforms in the national
financial market of a non-EU member state is an example of a foreign law
“intervention” in the financial system of the state. Foreign Fintechs may
affect certain market segments due to reliance on internationally recognized infrastructure support and change the competitive landscape in a
particular country, but not adhere to local regulations. In this context,
the question of ownership of personal data and the freedom to dispose of
one’s personal data is increasingly being raised.

Today, there are three major trends on how to regulate data protection: adoption of specialized legislation covering several areas of the law,
constitutionalize rules on data protection, and international harmonization of data protection regimes (Moura & de Vasconcelos, 2020). Not
to underrate the value of national legislation, this research demonstrates
that because of the transborder character of Fintech, there is a need to
harmonize national policies toward personal data protection.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop regulatory principles for managing
Fintech businesses based on the synergy of public–private and company–
client interests. In order to elaborate a principles-based approach, it is
necessary to bring together regulators responsible for different sectors
and functions of Fintech as well as international institutions (Arner et al.,
2021). Using this approach as a basis, states could introduce a multilateral
framework for Fintech and cross-border data processing and storage, as
well as dispute resolution.
Besides common principles, an international legal framework should
proclaim the basic rights of data subjects, i.e., consumers of Fintech
services. They should be based on the idea that data privacy covers public
and private law issues (Moura & de Vasconcelos, 2020) and considers
public security and the needs of private businesses and individuals.
Of course, special attention is to be paid to the states’ right to
apply their laws to foreign Fintech companies, including the question of
liability. It seems that because of differences in national laws, extraterritorial law enforcement has a controversial nature, while another approach,

44

data localization, would result in higher costs. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a new concept of law enforcement, or conclude an
international convention establishing a model law standardizing and
harmonizing national approaches in cases where Fintech and data privacy
are concerned.
In order to prepare the ground for this initiative, the key features of
different legal policies should be described, analyzed, and reconsidered.
Otherwise, the Fintech industry will suffer legal uncertainty, which inter
alia, will restrain development of the industry and innovation. Adoption of
data processing and data transferring principles is to be organized jointly
with an implementation of their commonly accepted definitions. This
step will provide legal certainty, which is a cornerstone to any regulation
(Amstad, 2019).
The concept of personal data, including basic principles and definitions,
introduced in the GDPR is quite universal, and allows talking about the
extension of the GDPR into the sphere of Fintech, which contributes to
the best control over customer information collection. It seems reasonable, based on these Regulations, to harmonize the laws of different
countries in order to avoid conflicts of laws, especially if it concerns the
control of data mining by large multinational IT companies.
Standardization
Fintech companies don’t guarantee the availability and clarity of the
necessary information about the technologies and related legal, financial and other consequences of utilizing their Apps and services. In fact,
when accepting the provisions of a user agreement and giving consent
to the processing of their personal data, customers “are often unaware
of the amount and the type of information collected about them as well
as about how this information can be connected via artificial intelligence
technologies to infer their characteristics” (Cortez, 2020), and unable to
resist the imposition of rules by Fintech companies. This means that there
is a total shift of responsibility toward the individual who gets themselves
into an aggressive financial and technological environment. Therefore, the
privacy statements should be modified in a way that is in the interest of
the customer. To wit, users are granted the right to modify a privacy
statement and App data privacy settings, especially in the question of the
transfer of personal data to third parties. It is also important that the

3

PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND PUBLIC INTEREST …

45

privacy statement is written in plain language and contains all the necessary information on how the application and service will use the user’s
information. In this case, the problem is that there is not any single
standard on how to shape a data privacy agreement. The same is true
when we are talking about data security. The mitigation of cyber risks
and the monitoring of macro-financial risks are among the key issues
for cooperation (Chatzara, 2020). Consensus on cybersecurity standards
and their interoperability for the entire Fintech market will reduce questions concerning data exchange, and equalize banks which are subject to
stringent data privacy requirements with their competitors (Boot et al.,
2021).
Standardization in the sphere of Fintech only by means of governmental bodies, even in the frame of a single state, seems to be complicated, but self-regulation could overcome this challenge. Scholars argue
that ‘for digital finance platforms, regulators could seek to enter into coregulation agreements with operators that reflect public concerns such as
systemic risk, customer protection, market integrity, and national security’ (Arner et al., 2021).Thus, governmental bodies, banks, and software
developers could build a network for further dialogue and elaboration of
a self-regulation policy for the Fintech industry.
Mechanism of Supervision for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Exchanges
A combination of public and private keys provides data encryption and
anonymity in activities involving cryptocurrencies (Geranio, 2017). It
makes governance in the blockchain sphere difficult and stresses significant issues of various types (Vučinić, 2020), including the need for the
limitation of data privacy for the public good. The process of cryptocurrency–money exchange could still be supervised and legally regulated. In
this regard, Central Banks should adopt the sole general model which
will extend the rules of customer authentication, anti-money laundering,
etc. on cryptocurrency operations (Alekseenko & Gidigbi, 2021). Also,
within the framework of self-regulation and self-control, cryptocurrency
exchanges can develop a system allowing the implementation of techniques for user identification. Of course, this step will decrease data
privacy, but this sacrifice is not in vain, as it decreases criminal risks.

Conclusion
Fintech is transforming the financial services industry, and therefore,
requires special regulation or amendments to existing legislation. This
chapter illustrates that the main concern relates to the question of
the absence of recognized standards for data privacy and gaps in legal
regulation of data processing. Despite the fact that many countries are
developing a national framework for financial technologies, Fintech as
a cross-border technology has revealed many challenges in the financial
sector, which can be solved only by the harmonization of data privacy
approaches and data processing requirements for standardization in a way
which is mutually beneficial for public and private interests.

Financial Crimes in the Age of the Digital
Economy and FinTech
Eva Huang, Xi Nan, and Jun Zhao

Introduction
FinTech, as an emerging industry, is a significant component of the
digital economy, its business model overlaps with the banking business
model. The digitalisation of banks themselves means banks also carry on
FinTech businesses. In this context, many financial crimes have also been
digitalised.
This chapter aims to analyse financial crimes in the age of the
digital economy and FinTech, briefly explaining different types of financial crimes, such as money laundering, tax evasion, financial fraud or

dishonesty, cybercrime in finance, terrorist financing, bribery, and corruption. More specifically, this chapter provides an illustrative scenario of
the detection of financial crimes through the detection of cross-border
transaction-based tax evasion on social media platforms.

Definition of Financial Crime
Financial crimes consist of a wide range of activities, from fraud to actively
manipulating the stock market or laundering the proceeds of crime. From
two perspectives, financial crimes are attractive propositions for both
organised and serious crime. Firstly, organised and serious crimes are
always looking for exploitable loopholes, and fraud and market manipulation offer attractive opportunities for a quick financial return. Secondly,
just as legitimate business needs access to the financial system, so does
organised crime. Criminals aim to conceal either the criminal source of
their financial flows, or the criminal purposes of their funds.1

Types of Financial Crimes
Financial crime refers to any kind of criminal conduct that relates to
money or to financial services or markets, it is commonly considered as
covering the following offences:
a. Financial fraud or dishonesty; or
b. Cybercrime in finance and cyber security; or
c. terrorist financing; or
d. bribery and corruption; or
e. market abuse and insider trading, etc.
f. money laundering; or
g. Tax Evasion.2

Financial Fraud
Although the elements of fraud are worded differently in different pieces
of legislation, their substance commonly include:
• Acting dishonestly;
• The obtaining of property, gaining a financial advantage, or causing
a financial disadvantage; and
• In fact, this occurred by a deception.3
Financial fraud is a type of theft that occurs when a person or entity
takes or illegally uses money or property with profit-making intent. These
crimes commonly involve some form of subterfuge, deceit, or the abuse
of a position of trust, which distinguishes them from ordinary theft
or robbery. In the modern age, financial frauds can take many forms,
including digital forms.4
Cybercrime in Finance
Cybercrime in the financial sector is the act of obtaining financial gain
through profit-driven criminal activities, including email and internet
fraud, identity fraud, ransomware attacks, and attempts to steal financial
account, bank card or other digital payment information.5 Cybercrime
in finance includes acts such as obtaining financial accounts to initiate
unauthorised transactions, stealing payment card information, extortion,
identity fraud to apply for financial products, and more.6
As society increasingly relies on technology, the risk of data leakage
increases. Sensitive information such as the identity number, bank account
information, and credit card details are now stored in cloud storage
devices such as Apple (iCloud),7 Amazon (Amazon Web Services),8

Google Drive,9 Dropbox,10 Baidu Cloud,11 or specialised financial
services clouds such as UnionPay Cloud,12 which may harm an individual’s financial health. Financial cybercrime can affect individuals, companies, and industries of all sizes, and can have dramatic consequences.
Terrorist Financing
Terrorist financing is any form of financial support for terrorism or for
those who encourage, plan, or participate in terrorism. It usually falls into
two categories:
• financing direct costs associated with the perpetration of terrorist
acts, such as expenses for travel, explosive materials, weapons, and
vehicles,
• funds needed to maintain terrorist organisations, cells, or
networks.13
The process of terrorist financing generally consists of three stages:
• “Raising funds (such as through donations, self-funding, or criminal
activity)
• Transferring funds (to organisations, cells, or networks)
• Use of funds (for example, to buy weapons or bomb-making equipment, to pay insurgents, or to pay for the living expenses for terrorist
groups).”14
Funds are also required to be stored at each stage of the terrorist
financing process. Storage can be by stashing cash in a private residence

or in a cash box, or by depositing funds in a bank account or other financial products. In the digital economy, digital assets or crypto-assets could
also be ultilised.15
In all terrorist financing cases, these stages may not be present or
clear. To fund larger terrorist organisations, funds may be moved through
different layers of the network’s structure—for instance, from an American cell which raised funds, to a governing branch of a terrorist group
overseas, and then on to a local cell in a foreign country. Simpler cases
may be an American citizen directly funding an overseas insurgent or their
domestic activities.
Terrorist financing funds are considered “criminal instruments”,
meaning either illicit or legitimate funds are used for criminal purposes.
In this way, funds used to finance terrorism are similar to funds used to
commit most other crimes (for instance, paying people smugglers). The
three-stage process discussed above can also describe the illicit financial
flows involved in other types of financial crimes.16
Bribery and Corruption
Bribery and corruption have historically been considered as a contributing
factor to certain types of financial and organised crimes, such as through
bribes to law enforcement agencies or undue influence on decisionmaking. Modern forms of corruption, however, have often been explained
as transnational in nature, are more intertwined with financial crime.17
Both types of crimes have similar drivers, relying on similar mechanisms to divert and launder illicit financial flows, and deprive societies of
much-needed financial resources. They threaten not only the social and
economic stability of other countries around the globe, but also the rule
of law and democracy.18

Transparency in political funding may also ensure that political and
electoral campaigns are not tainted by proceeds of corruption and
economic crime and could help prevent the capture of state institutions.
Certain tools for combating bribery and corruption can be more effectively coordinated because of these common features.19 For example, a
public register of beneficial ownership might prevent the use of shell
companies for laundering the proceeds of corruption and financial crimes.
In addition, international cooperation is required in the investigation and
prosecution of corruption and financial crime schemes and in the recovery
of assets. Transparency in political funding also ensures that political and
electoral activities are not influenced by the proceeds of bribery and
corruption, in order to help prevent the capture of state institutions.20
In November 2021, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention established
legally binding standards to criminalise bribery of foreign public officials
in international business transactions and set out a range of measures to
bring them into force. It is the first and only international anti-corruption
instrument focusing on the “supply side” of the bribery transactions. The
2021 Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public
Officials in International Business Transactions complements the AntiBribery Convention with a view to further strengthening and supporting
its implementation.21
Market Abuse and Insider Trading
The concept of market abuse often includes insider trading, illegal disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. More specifically,
insider trading involves profiting from dealing in securities through the
intentional exploitation of confidential information obtained through
a privileged relationship or position within the entity.22 Stewart and

ImClone’s case23 is a type of market abuse and insider trading example
for illustrative purposes.
In December 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
announced that it would not approve a new cancer drug called Erbitux
made by the company ImClone Pharmaceuticals. With the drug expected
to be approved, it represented a major portion of ImClone’s future
growth plans. As a result, the company’s stock price fell rapidly. While
many investors suffered losses from the fall, the family and friends of
Erbitux CEO Samuel Waksal were not hurt. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission later found that before the FDA announced its
decision, numerous executives had sold their stock at the direction of
Waksal, who had also attempted to sell his own stock.24
In fact, just days before the announcement, U.S. retailer Martha
Stewart had sold about 4,000 shares of the company. At this point,
the stock was still trading at a high level, with Stewart making nearly
$250,000 on the trade. Over the next few months, the stock plummeted
from about $60 to just over $10.25
Stewart claimed to have a pre-existing sales order with her broker, but
it was later discovered that the broker, Peter Bacanovic, tipped her off that
the stock of ImClone was likely going to fall. Stewart eventually resigned
as the CEO of her own company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.
Waksal was arrested and sentenced to more than seven years in prison
and fined $4.3 million in 2003. In 2004, Stewart and her broker were
also convicted of insider trading. Stewart was sentenced to a minimum of
five months in prison and a $30,000 fine.26
Illicit Financial Flows
Different types of financial crimes share one common characteristic,
that is, financial crimes are always associated with illicit financial flows.
Illicit financial flows refer to the cross-border movement of funds that is
illicit in its source (for example, corruption and smuggling), its transfer
(for example, tax evasion), or its use (for example, terrorist financing).
These financial flows have been a growing global focus over the past

two decades, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has played
a key role in international efforts to combat these opaque and often
destabilising capital transfers.27
The IMF has also long been concerned with financial flows that, while
not strictly illegal, are linked with tax avoidance caused by aggressive tax
planning.28 The issue of illicit financial flows is at the top of the international agenda. Governments around the world are joining forces to
fight tax evasion and money laundering, which make up the bulk of illicit
financial flows.29
Money Laundering
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has defined money laundering
as.
The goal of a large number of criminal acts is to generate a profit for
the individual or group that carries out the act. Money laundering is the
processing of these criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin. This
process is of critical importance, as it enables the criminal to enjoy these
profits without jeopardising their source.30

When criminal activities produce substantial profits, involved parties
always find ways to control the funds without drawing attention to the
underlying activity or the people involved. Criminals do this by obfuscating the sources, altering the form, or moving the funds to places where
they are less likely to attract attention.
The Financial Action Taskforce’s Role in Anti-Money Laundering &
Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF)
Illicit arms sales, smuggling, and organised crime activities, such as drug
trafficking and prostitution rings, can produce huge profits. Embezzlement, insider trading, computer fraud schemes and bribery can also

generate large profits and create an incentive to “legitimise” illicit gains
through money laundering.
To respond to growing concerns about money laundering and terrorist
financing, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering was established by the G-7 Summit in Paris in 1989 to develop
a coordinated international response. The FATF currently consists of 37
member jurisdictions and 2 regional organisations, representing most of
the world’s major financial centres.31 There are 8 FATF-style regional
associate members, such as Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering
(APG), Council of Europe Committee of Experts on the Evaluation
of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism
(MONEYVAL), and Financial Action Task Force of Latin America
(GAFILAT). The United States, Australia, India, and China are members
of both FATF and APG.
One of the FATF’s first tasks was to develop a total of 40 recommendations that set out the measures national governments should adopt
to implement effective anti-money-laundering programmes.32 The FATF
Recommendations cover criminal justice system & law enforcement,
financial system & regulation, and international cooperation.
Other than FATF recommendations, FATF Standards also consist of
methodologies to assess the effectiveness of the Anti-Money Laundering
(AML)/Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) systems, and procedures for
the Fourth Round of AML/CTF evaluations.33
Essence and Stages of Money Laundering
Based on FATF’s definition, money laundering is a crime of deception,
and it refers to the “process whereby criminals attempt to disguise and
legitimate their ill-gotten gains of crime”.34 The essence of money laundering is to disguise the true nature, source, movement, or ownership of
property or funds, with the aim to legitimate assets by pretending that
property or funds come from a legal source (for example investment),
but in reality property or funds come from an illegal source (for example

drug trafficking).35 In short, there is always an underlying crime where
property or funds come from, and the reason for laundering illegal money
is to avoid the detection, not to make money.
There are three common stages used to disguise the source of illicit
income and make it usable in money laundering activities:
• Placement: Money is introduced into the financial system, commonly
by dividing it into various deposits and investments.
• Layering: Money is transferred to generate distance between it and
perpetrators.
• Integration: Money is then returned to perpetrators as clean funds
or legitimate income.36
Money launderers often adopt methods to avoid detection and conceal
the true source of funds. Some of the most commonly used methods are
outlined below.
Smurfs
Not in any way related to the children’s cartoon, the term “Smurf” is used
to describe a money launderer who wants to evade government scrutiny.
They hide funds by using placement, layering, and integration stages.
Large amounts of funds are deposited into different banks in smaller
transactions.37
It is required that financial institutions report large deposits of more
than $10,000 or what they deem suspicious to financial regulators and
authorities. By depositing small amounts of funds or smurfing, money
launderers can go under the radar and make the funds they deposit appear
to be of legitimate origin.38

Mules
A mule is an individual hired by money launderers to help run money
laundering schemes. Money mules are similar to drug mules, they may
be involved in the scheme, or they may be unknowingly recruited. Those
who are hired are often approached by money launderers and often have
no knowledge of the scheme. They may be attracted to the promised jobs
that pay good rewards. Criminals usually target individuals who are out
of the spotlight, including those without criminal records or financially
vulnerable.
One of the duties of a mule is to open a bank account and deposit
funds in the bank. Money launderers then start making wire transfers
and use currency exchanges to move funds around the financial system
to evade further detection.39
Shells
Shell or Shell corporations means a company that does not have any
business activities or operations, physical operations, assets, or employees.
Many shell corporations are legitimate business entities that are used to
raise capital, finance the operations of start-ups, or manage mergers and
acquisitions.40
Other cases may also involve fraudsters making shells who wanted
to hide illegal activity and/or evade taxes. Many individuals do this by
setting up shell companies in a jurisdiction that guarantee anonymity,
allowing them to deposit and transfer funds into different accounts. Shell
also allows taxpayers to avoid reporting income and fulfilling their tax
obligations.
Legal Analysis of the Crime of Money Laundering
This chapter outlines the crime of money laundering in common law and
civil law countries, using Australia and China as examples, respectively.

According to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Act ), a crime
consists of “physical elements” and “fault elements (also known as mental
elements)”.41 Proof of the commission of a Commonwealth offence now
requires proof of the “physical elements” of the crime associated with the
“fault elements” applicable for each physical element. Unless an offence
falls into the unusual strict liability offence category, the prosecution must
show that both elements exist to prove that a person has committed the
crime.42
Physical elements under the Act may be either:
“a. conduct (defined as an act, an omission to perform an act or a
state of affairs);
b. a result of conduct; and
c. a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct,
occurs.”43
Fault elements under the Act may be:
“a. intention;44
b. knowledge;45
c. recklessness;46 and
d. negligence.”47

The fault element is also known as mens rea in Latin. The literal
translation of the term “mens rea” is “guilty mind”,48 which refers to
criminal intent. In criminal trials, establishing the guilty mind of an
offender is a necessary element to prove guilt. The prosecution must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime
with a culpable state of mind.49 According to a famous explanation of the
concept by Justice Holmes, “even a dog knows the difference between
being stumbled over and being kicked”.50
The guilty mind requirement is premised upon the idea that a person
must possess a guilty state of mind and be aware of their misconduct;
however, the defendant is not required to know that their conduct is
illegal to constitute a crime. On the contrary, the defendant must be aware
of the facts that make their conduct fit the definition of a crime.
For example, if a person deliberately strikes another person without
a legitimate reason (such as self-defence) without that person’s consent,
it constitutes an assault. The prohibited conduct is the striking (physical element) and the fault element, or guilty mind, is the intention to
hurt/injure/attack/strike. On the other hand, if one person accidentally
strikes another person, a criminal offence will not occur since the fault
element does not exist.
To use the Australian law on AML/CTF as an example, there are
many (19) different money laundering offences in the Criminal Code
Act 1995.51 According to Sections 400.3–400.8 of the Act, 18 of the
19 offences may be classified by the state of mind of the defendant, and
the amount of money involved where the defendant deals with “money
or property that is the proceeds of crime or is an instrument of crime”.52

In other words, to prove the money laundering, prosecution must
prove state of mind (fault elements) and conduct of the accused (physical elements). When the defendant believes the money or property is
proceeds of crime or intends that money or property will become an
instrument of crime, the fault element of intentional money laundering
can be proved. If the proceeds reach $1 million, the defendant will be
sentenced to up to 25 years in prison. When the defendant is reckless of
the money laundering fact, if the proceeds reach $1 million, the defendant will be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison. When the defendant is
negligent of the money laundering fact, if the proceeds reach $1 million,
the defendant will be sentenced to up to 5 years in prison.53
Section 400.9 covered the scenario that “possession of property
reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime”.54
The Crime of Money Laundering—In Civil Law Countries: China
as an Example
China has identified money laundering as one type of crime with very
specific predicate crimes.
According to Article 191 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic
of China,
“Whoever, while clearly knowing that the funds are proceeds illegally
obtained from drug-related crimes or from crimes committed by mafias or
smugglers and gains derived therefrom, commits any of the following acts
in order to cover up or conceal the source or nature of the funds shall, in
addition to being confiscated of the said proceeds and gains, be sentenced
to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years or criminal detention and shall also, or shall only, be fined not less than five percent but not
more than 20 percent of the amount of money laundried; if the circumstances are serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of
not less than five but not more than 10 years and shall also be fined not
less than five percent but not more than 20 percent of the amount of
money laundried:
(1) providing fund accounts;
(2) helping exchange property into cash or any financial negotiable
instruments;
53 Above n45.
54 Above n45.

(3) helping transfer capital through transferring accounts or any other
form of settlement;
(4) helping remit funds to any other country; or
(5) covering up or concealing by any other means the nature or source
of the illegally obtained proceeds and the gains derived therefrom.
Where a unit commits any of the crimes mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, it shall be fined, and the persons who are directly in charge
and the other persons who are directly responsible for the crime shall
be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years or
criminal detention.”55

In June 2021, the People’s Bank of China released the draft version
of amended Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Law for public comment.
The Amended AML Law contains significant changes to improve the
effectiveness of its legal framework for combating money laundering and
terrorist financing and has expanded AML obligations to all individuals
and organisations.56
Money Laundering in the Digital Age
In the digital age, money launderers always find modern ways of money
laundering, putting a new spin on the old crime by ultilising the internet
to evade detection.
A key factor in money laundering is being closely watched. The use of
the Internet makes it easy for money launderers to avoid detection. The
rise of online banking institutions, anonymous online payment services,
peer-to-peer transfers using mobile phones, and the use of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have made it increasingly difficult to
detect illicit fund transfers.
Some examples are listed below to explain how technology can further
help money laundering activities57 :

• The use of proxy servers and anonymizers. These tools make integration nearly impossible to detect, as funds can be transferred or
withdrawn with little or no trace of an IP address.
• Funds can be laundered through online auctions and sales, gambling
websites, and even virtual gaming sites. Ill-gotten gains are
converted into the currency used on these sites, and then transferred
back into real, usable, and untraceable clean money.
• Advertise phishing scams targeting victims’ bank accounts. Fraudsters defraud victims under the pretext of depositing virtual lottery
wins or international legacies. Instead, they put multiple deposits
into the account and stipulate that some of the money must be
transferred to another account.58
Compliance Risks for Banks and FinTech Companies
Illicit financial flows will result in different types of compliance risks
to banks and FinTech companies, where they are required to take
measures to improve compliance. Enhanced due diligence, suspicious
matter reporting, and managing risks of tipping-off offences are three
measures to manage compliance risks.59
Enhanced Due Diligence
Due diligence is the investigation or exercise of care that a reasonable
business or individual would normally expect to take before signing a
contract or an agreement with another party or acting with a certain standard of care. Customer due diligence (CDD) is an important and complex
area in the world of Financial Crime Compliance (FCC). Customer due
diligence is the processes used by financial institutions to collect and
evaluate relevant information about customers or potential customers.60
Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) refers to an advanced Know Your
Customer (KYC) due diligence process that provides further risk investigation. EDD is designed to handle high-risk clients and large-value

transactions. Risky customers and transactions pose a greater risk to the
financial sector that cannot be detected by CDD procedures. In this
case, EDD procedures have been adopted to attempt to create a higher
assurance of identity by taking the customer’s identity and addressing
and assessing the customer’s risk category. Additionally, when there is
an increased opportunity from money laundering, terrorist financing
through the service and product or customer may present a high-risk situation; therefore, these procedures are required to mitigate the increased
risk.61 In the digital age, KYC and EDD can be automated through
digital technology.
Some types of higher risk customers are listed:
•
•
•
•
•
•

“Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)
Non-resident customers e.g., foreign students
Accounts opened by intermediaries e.g., lawyer’s trust account
Holding assets on behalf of other persons e.g., trustees
Cash-intensive businesses e.g., casinos
Difficulty in identifying beneficial owner of account e.g., nominee
shareholdings
• Complex or unusual ownership structure of customer”62

Suspicious Matter Reports

(AUSTRAC) defines suspicious matter reports (SMR) as,

The police rely on financial transaction information to track criminals and
criminal activity. The timeliness of suspicious matter reports is critical to
protecting Australians from serious crime and terrorism.
It is required to submit an SMR to AUSTRAC:
• within 24 hours if the suspicion is related to terrorism financing
• within 3 business days if the suspicion is related to other matters
such as money laundering64

The Offence of Tipping-Off
The offence of tipping-off is committed when a person knows or suspects
(subjectively) that a protected or authorised disclosure has been made and
makes a disclosure to a third party (the client) that is likely to prejudice
any investigation which either is or might be conducted.65
In Australia, penalties for tipping off can include up to two years in
prison and/or a fine of up to 120 penalty units.66
In the digital economy, these three compliance risks are more complicated, where digitalisation of the exchange of information, as well as the
nature of the Internet, means that there are unexpected consequences
arising from automation. These consequences could be social, ethical, or
environmental in nature. Little research has been done in relation to these
consequences due to the difficulties in detection of relevant crimes and
associated risks. The following section illustrates the feasibility of detection through an analysis of the detection of tax evasion as a financial
crime.

Tax Evasion
Tax evasion refers to the deliberate non-payment of taxes by individuals
and entities. Tax evasion often means that taxpayers intentionally misrepresent the true state of their affairs to tax authorities to reduce their tax
payables. It also includes false tax declaration, where the income, profits,
or gains declared by those tax evaders are lower than the amount earned,
or the deductions are over claimed.67 Clotfelter’s definition of tax evasion
has been well-accepted, and he stated that.
Tax evasion can be defined as any criminal activity or any offence of dishonesty punishable by civil penalties that is intended to reduce the taxation
incidence, and depends on economic and tax structures, types of income,
and social attitudes. The basic theoretical model of tax evasion is a straightforward application of individual choice under uncertainty and the problem
an individual faces is whether or not to evade some part of his legal tax
liability, given that there is some probability of being caught if he decides
to evade.68

Based on these concepts of tax evasion, it can be considered that tax
evasion usually exists in the following situations: by concealing all or
part of the taxable revenue or transactions which have already occurred,
such as destroying or concealing an accounting record, preparing false
accounting related documents and statements (for example, overstating
revenue, failing to record expenses, and misstating assets and liabilities are
all ways to commit accounting fraud), not issuing a tax invoice, receipts
or tax-related bills, etc., and accompanied by fraudulent declarations,
dishonest declarations or omissions of declarations, taxpayers fail to pay
or pay less tax than they should have paid.69
Tax evasion directly violates taxation and criminal laws, and this violation is mainly reflected in the use of the methods mentioned above to

hide the actual taxable amount.70 There is no doubt that the use of these
methods will make it more difficult for tax authorities to carry out tax
administration.
Tax Evasion in the Digital Age
Traditionally, the hidden economy is defined as the economic system
in which businesses and individuals do not record or report all their
cash income. For tax purposes, traditional hidden economy refers to the
economic activity which takes place outside the tax system to avoid tax
liabilities. The activities may include cash payments made by consumers
which are then not reported as taxable revenue; and cash payments to
employees made outside their formal wage structure. These activities are
known as the “hidden”, “underground,” “shadow”, “grey”, or “cash”
economy. All hidden economy activities have a common feature, that is,
they will result in evasion of taxes, leading to governments facing tax
revenue loss.
Governments found difficulties in discovering transactions in the
hidden economy, and tax evasion arising from hidden economy transactions has been an enduring research topic71 for scholars of tax
administration and tax compliance.
In recent years, the digital economy grew with the development of
communications and information technology. Digital economy refers to
a series of economic activities that use digital knowledge and information as key factors of production, the modern information network as
an important carrier, and information and communication technology
as a driving force for efficiency improvement and economic structure
optimisation.72 As a result of the rapid development of the digital

economy, online marketplaces enable consumers to purchase goods globally, and the improvement of consumers’ living standards make them no
longer satisfied with domestically manufactured products. The volume
of cross-border transactions on digital platforms, therefore, continues to
grow.73
This chapter uses a detailed Daigou example to illustrate the essence of
tax evasion in the digital age, the detection difficulties of such digitalised
tax evasion, and a proposed RegTech Tool to achieve detection. For
more details, please refer to Eva Huang and Xi Nan, “Transaction-Based

Daigou Example
Tax administrators around the world are frustrated that they cannot catch
cross-border transaction-based tax evasion on digital platforms. Many of
these transactions are related to Daigous.
“Daigou” is originally a Chinese term that means three things: a group
of people who are buying agents, they buy overseas products outside
of China and ship the products to residents in mainland China; the
behaviour of acting as buying agents; and an “industry”. It now refers
broadly to an e-commerce channel between buyers and professional shoppers locating in different countries. Daigou activities can result in criminal
offences such as smuggling, tax evasion, and money laundering.

Daigous have also exploited social media platforms to engage in blackmarket activities, in effect participating in the digitalised hidden economy.
Our research has developed a machine learning strategy that enabled the
detection of digitalised hidden economy activities on social media platforms. We explored an example through Instagram. This research will
contribute to help address tax evasion arising from these Daigou transactions, which is necessary to detect and eliminate black-market (hidden
economy) activities.
How do Daigous conduct transactions? Social e-commerce refers to
a business model in which the buying and selling process is completed
on social media platforms. This model consists of cross-border and
domestic transactions, where sellers take advantage of their extended
social networks. Activities include all aspects of e-commerce, from instant
messaging to answering customer enquiries to receiving payments via
third-party payment methods that are Fintech tools. Here, the social
media platform is the primary place to generate business transactions.
There is evidence that Daigou transactions between Australia and
China, where Chinese consumers are the final purchasers, are widespread.
A 2018 episode of A Current Affair addressed the topic of the sizable
Daigou industry.74 The show revealed that the market size of the global
Daigou industry is about AUD$15 billion. The number of participants
in the Daigou industry in Australia is around 200,000 and China is the
destination to which most of their purchases are exported.75
Daigou and the Hidden Economy
The hidden economy is defined as “those economic activities and the
income derived from them that circumvent or otherwise avoid government regulation, taxation or observation.” The predominate platforms on
which Daigous engage are social media platforms that are digital payments
enabled. Hidden online Daigou transactions share the same characteristics as traditional hidden economy transactions, where merchants prefer
to receive anonymous or pseudonymous payments and do not declare the
taxable income.

The rapid development of the Daigou industry may have resulted in
serious tax evasion of income tax, and potentially also Goods and Services
Tax (GST), in both source and destination countries. For Australia, it has
been estimated that “up to $1 billion in undeclared taxable income may
be slipping through the net, leaving a potential tax bill in the hundreds
of millions”.
Machine Learning Based Regtech Tool to Achieve Detection
Daigous leave digital footprints in their social media transactions, which
enable detection with a suitable data-driven approach. In our recent
research paper,76 we developed a case study to conduct an experiment
on Instagram to search for Daigou transactions. We used #lipstick as the
key search word to detect posts which are related to hidden economy
activities. We built a design science artefact—a machine learning based
Regtech tool for international tax authorities to detect transaction-based
tax evasion activities on social media platforms.
To achieve detection, there were three stages in our research:
1. Data mining using Python (a type of high-level programming
language);
2. Qualitative manual labelling to develop insights to train the
machine;
3. Developing the Regtech tool to detect transaction-based tax evasion
activities on Instagram.
To build the dataset, the study employed data trawled from publicly
available Instagram posts, including their corresponding poster information. Instagram posts were mined using the hashtag #lipstick in the period
from 22 to 26 September 2019.
For each Instagram post, our study collected the username, post timestamp, number of likes, image, post text, and comments. The original
post text was included as the first comment due to the way Instagram
presents the posts. The study also extracted hashtags from the comments,

as these usually form a significant part of the textual information. The
study collected a total of 58,660 posts (short-lived and duplicated posts
included) and from this data, we produced a dataset of 2,081 randomly
sampled unique posts for manual data mining.
Stage Two in our project was the data treatment process to build the
training dataset for machine learning purposes. Before labelling, individual posts were examined for the purpose of designing the labelling
codes. Nine properties were codified in the form of true or false questions or multiple-choice questions, where the questions can be answered
in a form that the machine learning model can understand. This is similar
to coding answers to survey questions, but the researcher does not have
to ask the questions in the data collection process (Fig. 4.1).
Evidence of Hidden Economy Transactions
Our analysis indicates that 22.21% (464 out of 2081) of the sampled
available posts are related to hidden economy transactions and thereby
may result in tax evasion (see Fig. 4.2 for an example of the posts).
This high proportion suggests that hidden economy transactions on social
media platforms have become very common and may lead to significant
tax revenue loss. For further labelling results, please refer to our paper.

Based on these results, we developed a Regtech tool, which is a multimodal deep neural network, to automatically detect suspicious posts.
The proposed Regtech tool combines comments, hashtags, and image
modalities to produce the detection results.
Our model markedly improves the efficiency of detecting and
confirming posts that relate to transaction-based tax evasion. Without
the detection model, tax officers will need to randomly select the posts,
as indicated above. Applying the Regtech tool we develop in our model
enables an initial identification of suspicious posts before manual analysis.
Tax officers will then manually confirm whether these posts relate to tax
evasion.
Figure 4.3 represents the demo results of our Regtech tool, it gives the
detection score of an Instagram post to signal its relevance to transactionbased tax evasion activities, considering the comments, hashtags, images,
and their combinations within the post. The detection score ranges from
0 to 1, with “1” means the machine regards the post as highly suspicious
black-market sales.
Using our model Regtech tool, we can expect to achieve a 72% identification of tax evasion activities based on the algorithmically selected

suspicious posts. Therefore, with the same amount of effort, the efficiency
can be improved by more than 3 times.

Conclusion
This chapter explained different types of financial crimes, such as money
laundering, tax evasion, financial fraud or dishonesty, cybercrime in
finance, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption.
The RegTech tool achieves detection of the financial crime of
transaction-based tax evasion on social e-commerce. The financing of
these transactions give rise to illicit financial flows, illustrating that similar
technology could be adopted to detect illicit financial flows that result
from the digitalised version of other international crimes, such as money
laundering or terrorist financing. Global regulators are urged to pay attention to adopting digital technologies to assist in the detection of financial

Regulatory Innovation in FinTech
Hung-Yi Chen

Introduction
The financial technology (FinTech) industry has grown rapidly over the
last 10 years. On the one hand, the penetration of the internet and
widespread adoption of smartphones have made it possible for people
to complete transactions easily using mobile applications. On the other,
it has been driven by the huge demand for financial services from underbanked or unbanked groups. For example, Ant Group, a subsidiary of
Alibaba, has been working in the field of small loans for many years to
help SMEs using its e-commerce platform. Moreover, they also leverage
the data on user behavior to offer consumer loans in order to encourage
online shopping. In addition to the rise of FinTech business models
mentioned above, the digital transformation of banks in developed countries and the booming of digital finance in developing ones, such as

M-Pesa in Africa, are also important factors1 that have been driving the
rapid growth of the industry. However, we will not neglect the relevant
risks that accompany the emergence of this new industry. For instance, the
Chinese online lending industry, once the largest in the world, has been
associated with Ponzi schemes in the past few years that have resulted in
millions of investors losing their funds. In the case of Ezubao, the number
of victims was hundreds of thousands of people and the amount of money
involved topped 500 million RMB. We have also seen numerous hacking
incidents in the cryptocurrency exchange industry in Japan. Accordingly,
the market mechanism itself is not sufficient to protect consumers. In
order to pursue the sustainable development of this new industry, this
chapter aims to review the existing theories and academic discussion, as
well as to explore potentially better options for FinTech governance.

Introduction to FinTech Governance Theories
How should the fintech industry be governed? Some scholars have2
sought to categorize the attitude of global regulators towards FinTech,
including: (1) doing nothing; (2) cautious permissiveness through flexibility and forbearance; (3) restricted experimentation; and (4) regulatory
development. First, “doing nothing” refers3 to the practice of the financial regulatory authorities in China prior to 2015. At that time, the
FinTech industry was still in its early stages. In order to accelerate
the innovation and adoption of financial technologies, regulators tended
to wait and see instead of stifling this new industry. Secondly, “cautious permissiveness through flexibility and forbearance” entails offering a
friendly regulatory environment under the existing legal framework, such
as no-action letters or restricted licenses, so as to provide a certain degree
of flexibility for the industry’s development. Furthermore, the “restricted
experimentation” refers to the regulatory sandbox mechanism. Finally,
regulatory development consists of following the legislative process to
draft the bills that regulate the industry.

REGULATORY INNOVATION IN FINTECH

With respect to legislative objectives, there are three core dimensions of
financial regulation, which include: financial innovation, market integrity,
and rule simplicity. It has been pointed out that these three concepts are
difficult to achieve4 at the same time, at least from the perspective of U.S.
financial regulation history. The same study further noted that FinTech
has the following three key characteristics: (1) use of a large amount of
new data as the basis for FinTech products; (2) use of artificial intelligence
and machine learning as the core technology; and (3) the involvement of
many non-financial companies, which also leads to the possibility of information asymmetries between regulators and FinTech companies. Due to
the increasing complexity of business models, this will also make it difficult to implement the concept5 of financial regulation through the simple
and clear rules outlined above.
Instead of rules-based regulatory regimes, principles-based ones will be
considered,6 which provide a greater degree of flexibility. In some jurisdictions, there is controversy7 as to whether there should be regulation
first and then innovation, or innovation first and then regulation. Another
discussion is based on the regulatory pendulum, which points out that the
economic depression caused by the Financial Crisis certainly made recent
financial regulation stricter. On the one hand, the public expects strict
regulation to protect its investors; on the other, regulators also hope to
avoid any financial risks via strict regulation and to reduce the risks of
public pressure.
Lastly, the recent emergence of the TechFin industry has been widely
discussed. This marks a new global trend8 in non-financial companies
involved in financial businesses, especially in the technology, e-commerce,

address innovation-particularly technological innovation-typically center around questions
of whether to regulate in advance of innovation or whether to allow innovation to develop

or telecom sectors. For example, China’s Alibaba’s Ant Group offers a
variety of financial services, such as Alipay, and the U.S. Facebook has in
recent years invested in Libra coins, which are available in most countries
of the world. The main advantage of these companies is that they have a
large number of users and their data for credit assessment, which can then
be used for financial business development.9 This also makes the existing
laws, which are primarily tailored for financial companies, not especially
applicable for TechFin ones.

The Potential of Public and Private
Governance for FinTech
In was noted above that most discussion thus far has focused on how
the public sector should regulate FinTech, but there has been a lack
of discourse on how the private sector could contribute to FinTech
governance. With the increasing complexity of contemporary society, it
is doubtful whether a top-down regulatory model can perform optimally, e.g., the public-sector-oriented supervision approaches in most
jurisdictions across various industry sectors.
With the recent establishment of the Innovation Office and Regulatory
Sandbox, it is apparent that the orientation of regulators has shifted from
pure supervision to governance. Instead of the supervision mindset, how
to lead the development of FinTech and be competitive at the global level
is an important objective that regulators take into consideration. In addition, the study suggests that industry self-regulation (self-governance)10
should be considered to provide better forms of governance, as in
the establishment of industry associations and the implementation of
self-regulation rules11 through the reputation mechanism.
This chapter reviews the FinTech regulations from selected jurisdictions and observes that the regulatory framework falls into four
distinct categories: (1) supervision-oriented approaches driven by public
sectors; (2) collaboration-oriented approaches driven by public sectors;
(3) supervision-oriented approaches driven by private sectors; and (4)
collaboration-oriented approaches driven by private sectors. The chapter

also aims to provide concrete examples that cross three major FinTech
markets, namely, China, the United States, and UK and to conclude the
best practices or early lessons learned. It also highlights the benefits and
challenges presented by each regulatory approach.
Supervision-Oriented Approaches Driven by Public Sectors: The U.S.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act
The U.S. JOBS Act was one of the first regulatory response to the
emergence of the FinTech industry, especially regarding equity-based
crowdfunding. The background of the JOBS Act was that the Financial
Crisis of 2008, which caused a global economic depression and rising
unemployment rates. In order to remedy the issue of unemployment, the
U.S. authorities encouraged the public to start their own companies as
a means of creating job opportunities. At the time, crowdfunding was
becoming popular around the world, and many people were using it as a
channel to raise the funding they needed to put their ideas into practice
with financial support from the public. Accordingly, lawmakers sought to
amend regulation to make crowdfunding a legal way for new businesses
to raise funds from the public, as well as to create a better capital market.
In order to ensure that the risks were controllable, the JOBS Act
limited the annual fundraising amount of each fundraiser and required
them to comply with disclosure obligations. In addition, it also sets an
annual cap on the total amount of investment of each general investor to
secure funds, given that equity-based crowdfunding is risky. However, it
is worth noting that although the Act was first announced in 2012, it did
not take effect in the United States until 2015, with three years needed
for the entire legislative process entailed. Of course, it is necessary to plan
well when drafting the law. However, this is obviously time-consuming
and could not keep pace with the rapid development of technology.
In addition to the problem of time expenditure addressed above, more
importantly, the fast-changing business models of FinTech firms also
present huge challenges to regulators. For example, initially, the peer-topeer lending industry simply matched borrowers and lenders as its chief
business model. In order to enhance the confidence of lenders in online
loans, online lending platforms prepared certain amounts of funding and

84

H.-Y. CHEN

guarantees to lenders that they could receive the principal on time.12 The
risks of the original model against the later one differ.
Therefore, there are two major disadvantages of “supervision-oriented
approaches driven by public sectors,” namely, that the legislative process
is time-consuming and business models change rapidly. It takes too much
time for new regulation, which cannot keep pace with development driven
by technology. The rapid change in business models is also another factor
that presents huge challenges. In the case of China’s peer-to-peer lending
industry, the regulatory authorities took a “do nothing” approach so as
to not stifle the initial emergence of financial technologies. They also
drafted a bill for peer-to-peer lending. As previously noted, there were
many problematic peer-to-peer lending platforms in China, some of which
were even involved in the Ponzi scheme. Eventually, in 2020, regulators in
China decided to crack down on the entire industry. Based on the above
case, it can be seen that the legislative process is unable to keep pace with
the speed of the development of the FinTech industry. It reflects that the
disadvantages of taking a traditional approach, such as new regulation or
amending the law in order to harness the innovation.
After the introduction of the JOBS Act in the United States, financial regulators around the world conducted a legal transplantation in
an effort to build alternative channels of fundraising and encourage the
founding of startups. However, it is worth noting that not every country
has been successful. In Japan, equity-based crowdfunding was legalized
through a legal amendment in 2015. However, by 2018, there had still
been no applications submitted to become a platform providing equitybased crowdfunding services.13 Another example is Taiwan, where there
are several equity-based crowdfunding platforms, but their total market
scale is only around 393,000 USD.14 These cases reflect the necessity for
12 “The P2P sector offers a good example of how regulation needs to proceed carefully
when creating rules for an industry. industry demands may represent nothing more than
a snapshot in time of their difficulties and may fail to address the evolving nature of
their business as it grows in terms of market size and risk.” Douglas W. Arner et al., The
Evolution of FinTech: A New Post-crisis Paradigm, 47 Georgetown Journal of International
Law 1271, 37–38 (2016).
13 “However, in the years following the amendment equity-based crowdfunding has
been virtually non-existent in Japan.” T. Ziegler et al., The 3rd Asia Pacific Region
Alternative Finance Industry Report 81 (2018).
14 “For example, even though three of six private platforms have been issued equitybased crowdfunding licenses and commenced operations in 2015, only 2 startups appear to

further legal amendments in both jurisdictions. However, as noted above,
the amendment process takes time and the business model will keep
developing and changing in parallel. Accordingly, “supervision-oriented
approaches driven by public sectors” will not be the only approach and
may not be the best one for FinTech governance.
Collaboration-Oriented Approaches Driven by Public Sectors:
Regulatory Sandboxes and Innovation Offices
As discussed above, the legislative processes required to facilitate
“supervision-oriented approaches driven by public sectors” take a long
time. They are thus unable to keep pace with the rapid development of
financial technologies. In order to accelerate and encourage the development of FinTech, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK introduced
a “regulatory sandbox” system, which provides a new regulatory mechanism. Specifically, the financial regulator offers financial technology
start-ups the opportunity to test their business models for a certain period
under certain conditions before relevant regulation is formally established. Instead of fully licensed business, the annual transactional amounts
and user groups are restricted to mitigate potential risks. For instance, a
company applying to enter the regulatory sandbox is allowed to start its
operations for “professional investors” within “a year” and not exceed the
transactional amount of “$1 million annually.”
In this way, FinTech companies can apply for entry into the regulatory sandbox in compliance with regulatory requirements and adjust
their business models through real operations to further development.
For financial regulators, the regulatory sandbox can also help them understand the potential risks associated with emerging business models and
make timely regulatory responses to companies utilizing the sandbox. To
this extent, the regulatory sandbox can encourage innovation by allowing
applicants to test their business models and ensure consumer protection
by certain restrictions. This would be helpful for a country seeking to
accelerate and boost the development of FinTech.
The regulatory sandbox focuses more on a collaboration-oriented
approach between the regulator and regulated companies. Although we
have successfully raised 12 million TWD (around US$393,000) on the licensed platforms
in operation by February 2017.” Cambridge Judge Business School, Cultivating Growth:
The 2nd Asia Pacific Region Alternative Finance Industry Report 68 (2017).

acknowledge the advantages of regulatory sandboxes, a previous study15
pointed out that in order to ensure that FinTech companies successfully pass the experiment, they have the capacity to take on a larger user
base. In a regulatory sandbox, business models are tested with restrictions on the number of transactions and their size. It is not the same as
the market scale and its associated real-world risks. Specifically, success in
the sandbox may only occur in the experimental environment. From this
perspective, this study argues that the regulatory sandbox still provides
the best balance between promoting innovation and consumer protection. The concept of a regulatory sandbox could overcome the issues of
“Too Small to Care,” “Too Large to Ignore,” and “Too Big to Fail.” It
offers a mechanism for regulators to work with FinTech companies and
determine better solutions.
With respect to legal transplantation, more than 50 countries around
the world have adopted the regulatory sandbox model; however, it is
worth noting that only a few have successfully fostered innovation. The
main reasons are two-fold, which include: (1) the organizational structure does not need to be adjusted accordingly; and (2) a lack of human
resources.
First, in terms of organizational structure, the regulatory sandbox
could be categorized as a singular framework or a multifaceted one. The
one introduced by the FCA in the UK and adopted by most jurisdictions falls into the former, whereas Thailand and Hong Kong deployed
the latter. In Thailand, the Central Bank, Securities Exchange Commission, and Office of Insurance Commission all have regulatory sandboxes.
FinTech companies can apply to their respective authorities according to
the type of business proposed. In practice, however, the business models
of FinTech are often associated with diversified fields, which might fall
within the scope of multiple regulatory authorities. In this case, it is
not clear to the applicant which regulatory sandbox ought to be chosen.
Moreover, the cross-organizational collaboration of regulatory sandboxes
is ambiguous. Hong Kong had a similar problem at first, but the regulator
changed to a single regulatory sandbox16 and the number of applications
significantly increased.

Second, it is also important to note that the UK’s regulatory sandbox
system assigns an expert to assist companies subject to it. To this
extent, if a country simply conducts legal transplantation of a sandbox
system without considering the required human resources, the regulatory
sandbox cannot operate optimally. This is also in line with a study that
pointed out the importance of the change in the functions of the supervisory authority; that is, the financial authority should make corresponding
adjustments in response to the digital transformation, such as through
the establishment of new organizations or positions to accelerate digital
development.17
Comparative studies across jurisdictions have indicated that China itself
is a huge regulatory sandbox18 ; however, this paper argues that the “do
nothing” approach taken by the Chinese regulatory authorities from 2015
is not equivalent to the regulatory sandbox model as discussed above. The
main difference is that the regulatory sandbox referred to is specifically
intended to test FinTech business models in a restricted environment,
such as in the presence of limitations on transaction amounts, investors,
and experimental period. Furthermore, the regulator is to actively work
with the applicants of a regulatory sandbox and together contribute to
FinTech development and better governance. This is quite different from
the “do nothing” approach.
In addition to the regulatory sandbox, the innovation office set up by
the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been introduced19 in
and the Insurance Authority had independent regulatory sandboxes, which made it difficult to test products that spanned jurisdictions.” UNSGSA FinTech Working Group,

(U.K. FCA), and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) functioning as first movers), communication between regulators and FinTechs has increasingly
been institutionalized through the development of innovation departments within Since
2015, institutional access points have been established in over twenty jurisdictions.” Ibid.

more than 20 countries around the world since 2015. The innovation
office aims to establish a communication mechanism between regulators
and FinTech companies. The names are different among jurisdictions; for
example, Japan’s Financial Services Agency has set up a FinTech Support
Desk, Singapore’s Financial Supervisory Authority has set up a FinTech
Office, and the South Korean government has established a FinTech
Center. All are designed to further strengthen communication between
regulators and FinTech companies and to help companies understand how
to apply for the necessary licenses20 and comply with the regulations.
It should be noted that the Innovation Office changes top-down supervision into horizontal collaboration with regulated businesses and helps
to unify the multiple windows in the financial authority, making internal
resources more effectively operated and improving external communication with prospective financial companies. Overall, it could help FinTech
companies start their businesses as soon as possible and boost FinTech
development in a country.

The U.S. JOBS Act, the Regulatory Sandbox, and the Innovation Office,
are all driven by public sectors. However, with the increasing complexity
of modern society and rapid changes in technology, it is doubtful whether
the government’s capacity remains sufficient to carry on. According to a
recent report,21 67% of U.S. federal statutes have never been updated
and 17% have only been updated once. Another study also pointed out
that unlike the ICT industry in the past, which was normally led by a
single company22 or a few companies, the digital economy is facing a
huge number of new companies and startups bringing innovation to the

industry around the world. Regulators are often unable to keep up with
the industry’s rapid development. The problems of “legislative dysfunctionality” and “agency resource constraints” are especially apparent due to
the complexity of the digital world.23 Therefore, it is necessary to explore
the feasibility and necessity of governance driven by private sectors.
In Japan, the cryptocurrencies exchange industry was not regulated
by the government at first. However, market players decided to form an
industry association and set up self-regulatory rules in order to maintain the industry’s reputation. Later, Japan established relevant laws and
regulations. However, the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange industry
association still plays an important role, and even those who wish to
apply for a license must be nominated by the industry association,
which shows its role in governance. In addition, in the UK peer-to-peer
lending industry, there was a similar industry association that played a
self-regulatory role before the UK FCA intervened. However, with the
implementation of the relevant regulations for a couple of years, the
industry association no longer exists, which differs from the practice of
Japan’s cryptocurrencies exchange industry.
In addition to the industry associations in Japan and the UK, the credit
ratings agencies on peer-to-peer lending in China is another example of
observing how the market works without regulation from the financial
authorities. As noted earlier, the peer-to-peer lending industry in China
has caused the public to be distrustful of the industry due to factors such
as Ponzi schemes. In order to help investors better understand the qualities among various peer-to-peer lending platforms in the market, credit
ratings agencies, such as Wangdaizhijia, Wangdaitianyan, and Rong360,
publish the scores of peer-to-peer lending platforms, which could serve
as references to help investors choose loan products corresponding to the
risks they can afford.
The research indicated that self-regulatory rules can be used as a tool24
to fill in regulatory gaps and improve the quality of regulation. Industry
associations can also serve as good communication channels between

quality of public regulatory oversight.” Brummer & Yadav, supra note 4, at 304–5.

regulators and the FinTech industry25 ; for example, the Canadian Financial Authority was in discussions with R3, a blockchain association
comprised of more than 80 financial companies, to decide whether to
adopt blockchain technology into the financial system.
It should also be noted that those outsourced business of financial institutions,26 especially that many financial institutions are currently adopting
cloud services provided by large technology companies. However, how
should financial regulators manage issues such as information security
presented by cloud service providers instead of financial institutions?
Specifically, ever more financial institutions rely on cloud platforms such as
Google or Amazon, but we have also seen that these cloud platforms have
had network problems lasting hours or days in the past few years. Who
should take responsibility for transaction losses incurred in such cases27 —
financial institutions or cloud service providers? This reflects the fact
that governance driven by public sectors might not be sufficient for the
increasingly complex society created by new technologies. Therefore, it is
urgent and necessary to further discuss how to leverage market reputation
mechanisms, the self-regulations of industry associations, or credit ratings
agencies to facilitate co-governance via public–private collaboration.
How to truly implement regulations driven by private sectors remains
a challenge. Unlike public sectors, private sector actors have no power
to compel implementation. Furthermore, for industry associations, the
market coverage of members, membership criteria, neutrality of the rules,
and the compliant system ensure that the self-regulatory rules set by
the association meet the industry’s expectations and avoid it gaining a
potential monopoly, all of which constitute approaches to pursuing better
governance driven by private sectors. In addition, doubts are often raised
about credit ratings agencies, such as whether they can perform their
duties fairly. On the one hand, they charge service fees from the rated
companies; on the other, they provide ratings services. How to be transparent and avoid those public concerns is highly critical for the further
evolution of the governance power of private sectors.

Collaboration-Oriented Approaches Driven by Private Sectors: Plug
and Play Abu Dhabi, Global FinTech Hackcelerator Singapore,
Taiwan FinTechSpace
Several regulators have launched FinTech accelerators, which are usually
operated by a semi-government organization. Accelerators typically
provide or facilitate mentoring, workspaces, consultations with industry
experts (including on regulation), networking opportunities, and access
to funding.28 For instance, Plug and Play Abu Dhabi, supported by the
Abu Dhabi Investment Office, aims to foster corporate innovation and
the integration of start-ups in businesses. Others, such as the Global
FinTech Hackcelerator organized by MAS, allow regulators to work with
firms to solve industry problem statements. The common characteristics of these accelerators are linked with regulators. Another example,
FinTechSpace in Taiwan, is a financial technology incubator supported by

Summary
In this paper, we built a simple framework to map out four regulatory approaches for harnessing the potential of financial disruption, namely: (1) supervision-oriented approaches driven by public
sectors; (2) collaboration-oriented approaches driven by public sectors;
(3) supervision-oriented approaches driven by private sectors; and (4)
collaboration-oriented approaches driven by private sectors. We summarize the above discussion in Table 5.1.
First, we consider the JOBS Act in the United States as an example to
observe how financial regulators respond to innovative business models
through legislation. From the above case, we can see that it takes too
much time for the legislative process and it is difficult to catch up with
the evolution of changing technologies and business models. In response,
policymakers around the world are creating “regulatory sandboxes” to
foster innovation in the financial sector while staying alert to emerging
risks. One key objective of sandboxes is to facilitate startups’ access
to capital. The UK Financial Conduct Authority pioneered the world’s
first regulatory sandbox in 2015. To date, more than 50 countries have
adopted sandboxes. This study also analyzed how private sector regulatory governance can complement regulatory gaps or fill out the gap of

insufficient regulatory capacity. For instance, the industry association of
P2P lending in the UK, P2PFA, made up a fundamental part of regulating the P2P lending industry before relevant regulation was issued
by the UK authorities. It is somewhat similar for the cryptocurrencies
exchange industry in Japan. Lastly, noting the global financial regulatory
trend, we can also observe that financial regulators have moved away
from their solely regulatory role to promote the development of the
industry by means of incubators, helping FinTech companies accelerate
their development.

Conclusions
This paper first analyzed the development of the FinTech industry and
associated risks, and then reviewed the academic discussions around
FinTech governance. It was determined that most studies primarily focus
on public sector regulation, with less attention paid to how private sectors
can contribute to better governance. Over the past decade, private sector
governance or co-governance also substantially influenced FinTech development. This paper aimed to provide case studies through various selected
jurisdictions and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the public and
private sector regulatory mechanisms in the hope that this could provide
another perspective on FinTech governance. The five key points conveyed
in this paper are as follows:
1. The increase in the number of market players: Compared to the
financial industry, which in the past was mostly dominated by large
enterprises, ever more FinTech innovations are initiated by startups.
Regulators are therefore facing the challenge of how to deal with the
rapidly growing number of FinTech products launched by a huge
variety of market players.
2. The complexity of business activities: FinTech now encompasses
payments, lending, fundraising, insurance, and robotic advisors. In
some cases, a single FinTech product could cover a variety of business areas. Accordingly, the increasing levels of innovation and the
complexity of changing business activities makes it more complex
than ever.
3. From strict supervision to agile governance: In the past, regulation placed more emphasis on strict rules to mitigate the risks. It
also aimed to implement regulation that was universal for the entire

94

H.-Y. CHEN

industry. In modern society, however, business patterns are changing
rapidly and regulation alone may not be the solution. Regulatory
actors should consider pursuing better governance through public
and private sector cooperation or regulation. This would be helpful
in mitigating the insufficient capacity of relevant authorities in the
digital world.
4. From risk-prevention to eco-system building: In the era of globalization, a regulator should not only prevent domestic risks but
also consider its competitiveness in its region and the world. As is
apparent in the cases of Abu Dhabi, Singapore, and Taiwan, regulators are actively building eco-systems to boost FinTech development
instead of engaging in strict supervision.
5. From supervision driven by government to co-governance: This
paper analyzes current FinTech governance from the perspective of
public–private collaboration. Each model has its own advantages and
disadvantages. These depend on the practices and needs of a jurisdiction. This study wishes to offer regulators a blueprint for FinTech
governance.
The study provides a matrix to map out four types of regulatory
approaches based on case studies across jurisdictions, spanning various
mechanisms, which includes regulation, innovation offices, regulatory
sandboxes, industry associations, credit ratings agencies, and governmentlinked accelerators. How these different mechanisms operate in theory
and practice is the subject of this comparative analysis. Such a comparative
view is essential to a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses
of the various mechanisms and their practical implementation. It aims to
unpick the complexity of how to harness the potential of FinTech. This
paper is aimed not only at scholars but also at the central banks and
securities and exchange commissions themselves, seeking to assist them
in revising their rules, as well as at states and organizations developing
future legal mechanisms or better approaches to governance.

Digital Assets and Central Bank Digital
Currency in ASEAN
Pawee Jenweeranon

Introduction
Digital assets have been utilized as fundraising tools and means of trade
in several Southeast Asian nations. These operations are being carried
out outside of any legal framework, causing considerable worry among
governments and regulatory agencies in many countries, who see them
as posing serious threats to national financial stability and retail investors.
However, apart from regulators and public concerns, governments and
regulators in ASEAN also recognize the potentials of ICOs, cryptocurrency and DLT technology in various ways, such as the recognition of
their potential for enhancing financial inclusion for start-ups as expressed
by the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is the
main regulator for supervising such activity.1

In recent years, many countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, have increased the number of digital token sales as a means of
fundraising. In 2018, successful ICO projects in many countries spurred
the regulators to regulate these activities in order to prevent fraudulent behaviour and scams. To demonstrate this increasing trend, the
blockchain start-up TenX successfully raised close to USD 80 million
through a token sale in Singapore.2 Also, in Thailand, there is an ICO
project called JFinCoin ICO launched by the J Ventures company, which
raised funds through digital token offerings in January 2018.
Consequently, this has led to the use of regulatory approaches among
ASEAN countries to prevent possible risks and to derive benefits from
this technology at the same time with bespoke regulatory solutions. For
example, the Royal Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, which was enacted
in Thailand, expressed the guideline (A Guide to Digital Token Offerings) that has been issued by the financial authority of Singapore and the
Capital Market and Services (Prescription of Securities) (Digital Currency
and Digital Token) Order 2019 as well as the Guidelines on Digital Assets
of the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC).3
In general, the problems of capital shortage facing small- and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in many countries led to the proposal of a
regulatory framework for alternative financing instruments outside the
traditional banking sector in national and regional legal regimes. Apart
from the efforts of many countries to improve the legal and institutional
framework for access to secured credit, financial technology or FinTech
is considered to be the solution. This is also because of industry backgrounds concerning the percentage of internet users, mobile phone users
and other related factors.
To reflect the significance and constraints of digital assets in general, to
exemplify this, tokenization will allow for the creation of a new financial
system and will undergo widespread adoption; however, regulation often
stands as an obstacle. To date, there have been a number of problematic legal issues potentially arising from asset tokenization. These include
the lack of clarity of the relevant regulatory frameworks, the lack of

co-ordinated activity between regulators as well as problematic issues
pertaining to the unclear legal rights and obligations of token issuers and
token holders. Because of this, the advantages of tokenization are potentially undermined unless regulators put in place a regulatory framework
which can appropriately balance risk prevention and market stimulation,
creating adequate asset support tokenization for SME financing. A regulatory framework as well as a policy toolkit are needed to adequately address
the legal, regulatory challenges and potential risks of asset tokenization.
In a broader sense, to be more specific, this chapter aims at exploring
current regulatory frameworks in ASEAN countries related to digital
assets in a broad sense.
From the aforementioned statement, digital assets can be used as alternative fundraising channels for businesses. Accordingly, to understand the
challenges in financial inclusion in ASEAN is necessary to understand
countries’ efforts to support the use of digital assets in general.
Financial Inclusion and Digital Finance
In recent years, financial inclusion has been a significant issue in Asia–
Pacific4 and other regions of the world. According to a publication from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), financial inclusion is associated
with economic growth in developing countries.5 In the case of financial inclusion and the use of technology, countries in Asia–pacific have
also made great progress to enhance financial inclusion through their
use of technology6 ; for instance, the adoption of digital financial services
including mobile banking and mobile money, as well as instant payment
schemes.

In the ASEAN region, banking penetration remains low in many jurisdictions, with only some 47% of ASEAN citizens having a bank account.
The huge gap among ASEAN countries can be seen with the 40% of the
Philippines population that has a bank account7 compared to Malaysia’s
80% account-holding statistic.8
It is worth noting that there have been many attempts, both international and domestic, to address the financial exclusion problem. To
this extent, the promotion of financial inclusion in the ASEAN region
was mandated in the Chair’s statement of the 19th ASEAN Summit in
Bali in 2011. Also, during the summit, ASEAN Ministers were tasked
with exploring new initiatives to address the problem. Accelerating financial inclusion in the Southeast Asian region with digital finance has been
proposed as the main solution by the Asian Development Bank (ADB);
a report published by the ADB further emphasized that collaboration
between different stakeholders such as regulators, public policymaking
institutions and supply-side participants is needed. Digital finance is
expected to increase financial inclusion.9 It also has the potential to boost
GDP by 2%–3% in Indonesia and the Philippines, and 6% in Cambodia.10
To be more specific, in order to grow financial inclusion in the region,
three primary foundations must be taken into account to enable the
spread of digital financial services (DFS). These include government and
private sector commitment to the development of DFS, a good ICT
infrastructure, as well as an appropriate legal and regulatory framework.11
From a legal and regulatory perspective, according to the ADB publication,12 regulatory frameworks for DFS can be categorized into many types

of specific regulatory frameworks; for instance, regulatory frameworks for
payment services and providers, e-money service providers, online lending
service platforms, equity-based crowdfunding platforms and as a banking
agent initiative.13
The benefits of enhancing financial inclusion, especially SME financial
inclusion, include helping increase economic growth at both the domestic
and regional levels. This is also due to the fact that SMEs play a key role
with respect to job creation and financial stability.14
Apart from the above-mentioned statements, which state the potentials
of digital finance in enhancing financial inclusion, it should be noted that,
in particular, digital financial services through mobile phone technology
has become one of the preference tools to address the current financial
exclusion challenges, especially in developing countries. To this, E-money
and mobile money can be seen as one of the primary ways in increasing
access to finance in a number of countries such as various African nations.
However, generally, even digital finance is widely accepted as an instrument for financial inclusion. Key risks from the use of digital finance can
reflect the need for a regulation and a supervisory approach. Risks might
have occurred due to the lack of knowledge and awareness in financial
services and products. To this, financial literacy and financial education
have the potential to act as supportive tools to prevent possible risks.
To enable businesses to offer new financial products and services, we
need a regulatory framework to mitigate potential risks and to support
market players who offer innovative products and services. This is also
to promote fair competition in the market, which can deliver benefits for
consumers through lower prices, greater choices, and improved services.
This includes laws and regulations for digital assets and its related activities
that could have a role in encouraging greater financial inclusion in many
ways.

Digital Assets Regulations
in Selected ASEAN Countries
This section aims to explore legislative and regulatory efforts in ASEAN
countries to reflect different regulatory approaches being used by regulators or policymakers. In this regard, digital asset regulations are a broad
term that reflects all relevant regulations concerning cryptocurrencies,
digital tokens, CBDCs, underlying technologies and related activities.
Indonesia
Indonesia does not recognize virtual currency as a non-cash payment
method on the grounds that it is its own currency and not the
Indonesian Rupiah. Bank Indonesia Regulation No.18/40/PBI/2016
concerning the Implementation of Payment Transaction Processes specifically prohibits the use of virtual currency in the payment transaction
process.
This regulation defines virtual currency as digital money issued by
parties other than a monetary authority and obtained through mining,
purchase or reward transfer, for example Bitcoin, BlackCoin, Dash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Nxt, Peercoin, Primecoin, Ripple and Ven.
Virtual Currency is not recognized as a valid means of payment and is
hence prohibited in Indonesia.
Such was declared by Bank Indonesia in a press release dated February
6, 2014 entitled “Pernyataan Bank Indonesia Terkait Bitcoin dan Virtual
Currency Lainnya”, which can be translated as “Statement of the Bank
Indonesia in relation to Bitcoin and other Virtual Currencies”. The statement expresses Bank Indonesia’s position that Bitcoin and other virtual
currencies are neither real currencies nor acceptable payment methods in
Indonesia. The general public is advised to exercise caution while dealing
with Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Any risk associated with Bitcoin
ownership/use is borne solely by the owner/user of this virtual currency.
Although virtual currency may be used as a form of payment in
Indonesia as stated above, virtual currency trading is not banned. Instead,
the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Badan Pengawas
Perdagangan Berjangka Komoditi) recently passed Regulation No.5 of
2019 concerning Technical Provisions on the Operation of Crypto Assets
Market in Futures Exchange, which allows virtual currencies to be legally
traded as commodities. Moreover, the regulation defines relevant terms

6

such as crypto-asset exchange, crypto-asset clearing agencies, crypto-asset
storage providers, as well as crypto-asset traders and clients. To this, the
rule provides greater regulatory certainty and reflects the development of
the regulatory framework concerning digital asset businesses.
Lao
Cryptoassets, like other FinTech products, are still in their development in Laos. Most financial transactions are still performed in cash15
in the country, and few people are conversant with technology. The
BOL, the country’s monetary authority, is very concerned about these
instruments and has issued a warning about the risks of cryptocurrencies. There are no data on the number of local citizens who trade or deal
with cryptocurrencies (or crypto assets in a broader sense).
While cash transactions are still preferred in the country among local
citizens, it was reported in 2018 that certain businesses have started
accepting cryptocurrencies as payment for products and services, as well
as promoting cryptocurrency investing and trading.16 One IT services
company even accepted donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum and ZeCash for
the victims of the July 2018 dam-disaster flooding in Southern Laos.17
The first cryptocurrency exchange Laos, Vientiane Exchange Money,
opened at the beginning of July 2018. This exchange offered the option
to exchange Bitcoin with other currencies and claimed to possess the
latest technology that will allow it to provide customers with the fastest
transactions for all currencies it offers, even featuring an ATM machine
for transactions.18
Similar to most countries across the globe, cryptocurrencies, on the
other hand, are not recognized as legal tender in the country. The

Payment System Law restricts payment instruments other than cash to
limited types of payment instruments.19 The terms “crypto assets”, “digital tokens”, and “distributed ledger technology” are also not defined in
any existing laws and regulations.
Notably, shortly after the launch of the first cryptocurrency exchange in
Vientiane, the BOL has issued a Notice on August 29, 2018 warning the
public against the use of cryptocurrencies, citing Bitcoin, Ethereum and
Litecoin as examples. It reminded the public that cryptocurrencies are not
real currencies and should not be used for payments under the Law on
Payment System. The BOL exhorts the Lao people to make an in-depth
study prior to investing or purchasing these products. It warns of the
significant risk attached, such as the potential for use in money laundering
or the funding of terrorist activities, and also cautioned traders on the
currency’s severe price volatility and potential to be offered as payment for
fraudulent activities.20 While the BOL’s Notice does not directly outlaw
cryptocurrencies, it has stifled their active growth and adoption in the
nation.
Interestingly, prior to the issuance of this Notice, a team of foreigners
in Laos launched Bananacoin, which markets itself as the first environmentally friendly plantation in Laos with a utility token based on
Ethereum that is backed by the market value of 1 kg of banana. Bananacoin is actually a combination of cryptocurrency and crowdfunding, with
the team behind the project hoping to use the investment gained from
the tokens to expand the land cultivated for bananas.21 The initial coin
offering (ICO) has already ended, with 6,812,551 million tokens sold.22
However, it is not clear if this company holds any authorization from the
BOL for holding of the ICO.
A crypto mining operator, Syan Technologies Limited of Hong Kong,
was also reported to be in talks with the Lao Government for the set-up
of a cryptocurrency mining facility on the banks of the Mekong river in

November 2017,23 but there has been no update on this potential project
and the website of the said company does not appear to be active.
The Government does not appear to be veering away from its negative
outlook on cryptocurrencies. With this outlook, coupled with the current
state of FinTech development in Laos, cryptocurrency market growth in
the country is expected to be slow and will continue to lag other nations
in Southeast Asia. Lao authorities will have to recognize the potential of
cryptocurrencies and the distributed ledger technology to develop policies
and implement regulations that would foster the growth of cryptocurrencies while continuing to protect the public against the potential risks of
this new technology.
Malaysia
Fundamentally, the Government of Malaysia realizes the potential of
digital assets and blockchain technologies in various industries. In fact, the
Finance Minister, Lim Guan Eng, noted that: “In particular, we believe
digital assets have a role to play as an alternative fundraising avenue
for entrepreneurs and new businesses, and an alternate asset class for
investors”.24 At the beginning of 2019, the SC issued the framework
for crypto exchanges, which states that the new framework will fall under
the purview of its Guidelines on Recognized Markets. In accordance with
the same guideline, there is the amendment of a section to introduce new
requirements for crypto exchanges. Specifically, under the regulation25 all
Digital Asset Exchange (DAX) Operators must be locally incorporated
and have a minimum paid-up capital of RM 5 million. A DAX Operator

is prohibited from providing financial assistance both in direct and indirect forms to investors, including its officers and employees, to investor
trade in Digital Assets on its platform. A DAX Operator shall gain the
approval from the SC of the trading of the digital asset before facilitating
such trading. The requirements further state that an internal audit function must be established by a DAX Operator in order to design, execute,
and maintain an internal audit framework that is suitable for the company’s business and operations. In addition, there is also a requirement
concerning which currencies are allowed to be used and invested on its
platforms.
Anyone interested in starting a digital asset platform was needed to
apply to the SC to be registered as a recognized market operator by
March 1, 2019, under the new rules. Anyone who conducts unlicensed
initial coin offerings (ICOs) or digital asset exchanges risks a 10-year jail
term and an RM 10 million punishment, according to the new rules.
Consequently, the guidelines for ICOs were released in March 2019.
Singapore
Back in 2017, according to the MAS, the use of virtual currencies is not
prevalent in Singapore, with just around 20 merchants accepting Bitcoins
at the moment.26 Furthermore, the usage of virtual currencies (or “digital tokens”) as a form of payment in the financial sector is limited, and
crypto-asset trading is mostly used for speculative investment reasons.
Financial institutions, on the other hand, acknowledge that the digital
token market is gaining traction.
This ecosystem, which includes “trading platforms, brokers, and wallet
providers”,27 may be outside the purview of authorities. While there is no
specific legislation to oversee crypto-asset operations in Singapore at the

moment, many existing laws may be applicable. Furthermore, the formation of organizations like the Token Economy Association (“TEA”)28
demonstrates MAS’ commitment to the growth of this new sector. TEA
also can be seen as a self-regulatory organization.
The regulatory body in charge of this sector, MAS, has adopted a
cautious approach to cryptocurrencies.29 The primary motivations of
Singaporean authorities’ response to crypto-asset operations have been
to provide consumer protection, maintain financial stability and unleash
technological innovation. The role of “digital tokens” has developed
beyond that of a virtual currency, according to MAS, and may now reflect
ownership or a security interest in an issuer’s assets or property, as well
as a debt owing by an issuer. The Commercial Affairs Department is also
responsible for rule enforcement and consumer protection (CAD). Unless
exempted, issuers and intermediaries of digital tokens would be subject to
licensing requirements under the Securities and Futures Act (“SFA”) and
the Financial Advisers Act (“FAA”), as well as anti-money laundering and
counter-terrorist financing regulations.30
In 2018, the TEA,31 an industry-sponsored self-regulatory organization, was established with the mission of monitoring digital tokens like
as bitcoin and developing effective methods to govern the sector. The
TEA is presently collaborating with the Association of Crypto-Currency
Enterprises and Start-ups Singapore to develop a code of conduct that
will include anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism funding and due
diligence processes (for identity authentication).32

In addition, regarding blockchain technology, the managing director
of MAS stated that the technology has great potential for making trade
finance safer and more efficient, and praised DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC and Bank of America for their accomplishments.33
Project Ubin and the Global Trade Connectivity Network are two initiatives that MAS has pursued in the last year with the goal of using
blockchain and Digital Ledger Technology (“DLT”).
To be more specific, in terms of relevant regulatory framework, the
varied features of digital assets, from security to non-security tokens,
lead to complexities from a regulatory standpoint. A token’s legal status
depends on its main function or the type of token being considered;
accordingly, the tokens’ categories are helpful for capturing the complexities of digital assets and to guiding effective regulatory responses. In
other words, the complexity of the structure of digital assets has led to
concerns from regulators and all relevant stakeholders, such as consumer
risk and money laundering concerns. It is necessary to understand the
core concepts and features of the main types of crypto assets in order to
understand the regulatory and supervisory implications.
As a result, for example, if the crypto assets or digital assets has the
attributes of a capital market product. The Securities and Futures Act
shall be applied to the case. According to the Act, capital market products include securities, units in a collective investment scheme (CIS), over
the counter (OTC) derivatives, etc. However, if the crypto assets has
the attributes of a commodity, the Commodity Trading Act34 is the key
legislation.
It should be noted that different entities have different approaches to
the labelling of different categories of crypto assets; however, most entities share the common consideration that the categorization of crypto
assets shall rely on their main functions and features. From the hybrid
features of a number of tokens in the market, the classification of such
crypto assets is not always as straightforward as has been proposed by the

the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which noted that “the definition
is far from globally uniform…”.
Thailand
Digital assets have been used as fundraising instruments and mediums of
exchange in Thailand without laws or regulations to regulate these activities. This led to concerns from the Thai government authorities as well
as key regulators about the potential impact of the activities on national
financial stability and public risk.
The Thai SEC published a statement on ICO in September 2016 that
highlighted many of the concerns regarding ICO abuse, public dangers
and cyber security-related problems; nevertheless, the Thai SEC said that
ICO has the potential to be an alternate method of financing, particularly for digital start-ups. As a result, the Thai Securities and Exchange
Commission was contemplating a suitable regulatory strategy for ICO
operations.
The Thai SEC is the main authority supervising and considering
all matters relating to digital asset businesses, including both digital
currency- and ICO-related activities.
To address concerns about the potential risks of using digital assets,
the Royal Decree on the Digital Asset Businesses B.E.2561 (2018) was
enacted to regulate the offering of digital assets and the undertaking of
digital asset businesses, which were categorized into three main types: (i)
Digital Asset Exchanges; (ii) Digital Asset Brokers; and (iii) Digital Asset
Dealers.36 In addition, further to considering the Royal Decree, business
operators shall comply with the rules, conditions and procedures specified in the notification of the Thai SEC, as well as the notification of the
Ministry of Finance of Thailand concerning sufficient sources of capital
and other requirements. For instance, the required paid-up registered
capital for the ICO portal operator is 5 million Thai Baht. In addition,
for key definitions that capture the scope of law application, digital assets

under the Royal Decree can fall within the scope of cryptocurrencies or
digital tokens.37
In summary, the Royal Decree, along with the subordinate legislation,
provides a licence requirement for restricted activities related to digital
assets.
Regarding the legal status of digital assets, in Thailand, in accordance
with the Currency Act B.E.2501, Section 6 of the Act stipulates that
Thai currency consists of coins and notes. Furthermore, Section 7 of
the Act adds that the official unit of currency is “Bath”. Thus, this Act
limited the definition of “currency” under the Thai legal system to two
forms, comprising coins and notes. The Act became effective in 1958.
Around 60 years ago, at the time of its enactment, there were still limitations in terms of the available form of money circulating in the market.
In addition, Section 9 of the Act prohibits any person from performing
certain activities in relation to money without authorization, with exceptions granted by the Ministry of Finance. To conclude, the Act does not
recognize virtual currency as Thai currency, and therefore it cannot be
regarded as a legal tender under Thai laws.
However, although virtual currency is not a legal tender under the
Currency Act of Thailand, for both parties, an obligation can be extinguished if the creditor accepts a virtual currency for payment transactions
instead of the official one.
Crypto Baht—Project Inthanon Initiative
Project Inthanon is the recent initiative launched by the Bank of Thailand
in collaboration with commercial banks; it is a wholesale digital currency
issued with the purpose of facilitating interbank settlements.
“These efforts should pave way for faster and cheaper transaction and
validation due to less intermediation processes needed compared to the
current systems”, stated by Dr. Veerathai Santiprabhob, Governor of the
Bank of Thailand in his “Thai Economy: The Current State and the Way
Forward” speech.38 This can also reflect the attempt of the Bank of Thailand to exploring new technologies such as Blockchain to improve its
operation.

Vietnam
In accordance with Decision No. 1255/QD-TTg,39 dated August 21,
2017, the Deputy Prime Minister appointed the Ministry of Justice to
lead and coordinate with the SBV in completing the legislative framework on the administration of virtual assets, digital currencies and virtual
money. Despite experts’ warnings about its hazards and the absence of
a management structure, Bitcoin gained substantial market interest in
Vietnam. The Ministry of Justice is currently evaluating existing regulations in Vietnam regarding the administration of virtual assets and
currencies.
As such, there have been some mixed opinions with regard to the
management of virtual currencies, especially Bitcoin or Litecoin. Previously, on October 30, 2017, the SBV stated that virtual currencies are
not a lawful means of payment, and that therefore, “from January 1,
2018, the act of issuing, providing and using illegal means of payment
(including Bitcoin and other similar virtual currency) may be subject to
prosecution in accordance with the provision of Article 206 of the Penal
Code 2015”, as conveyed in the SBV’s statement released on October
28, 2017. However, illegal transactions using Bitcoin continue.40
In the past, there was discussion surrounding new legislation that
would pave the way for a wider economic upheaval that would attempt
to tax Bitcoin as a digital asset in the foreseeable future, but cryptocurrencies have yet to be declared an asset or currency. The central bank
invoked Article 4.6 of Decree 101 of 2012 on non-cash payment; however,
current laws have not yet specified whether Bitcoin is a currency or a
commodity or payment instrument, which means that Bitcoin trading
services are not recognized as payment processing services, and therefore
the new decree does not apply to crypto exchanges and traders. As stated
by Deputy Prime Minister Vuong Dinh Hue, most cryptocurrency transactions are now related to investment or speculation, not as a medium for

trade or paying for services.41 As a result, the Vietnamese government
will continue to research and keep up with the latest advancements in
cryptocurrencies. The Ministry of Justice has also surveyed the development of cryptocurrencies in Vietnam and abroad in order to analyse the
pros and cons of the examined trends. This analysis will form the basis for
further consideration by the Vietnamese government.

ASEAN General Overview of Legislative
Efforts on Digital Asset Business Regulations
To summarize, Southeast Asian central banks have taken a cautious stance
on the rise of virtual currencies in terms of their potential risks to the
public. Also, there are no laws and regulations in any countries designed
to regulate cryptocurrencies themselves; however, there are laws, regulations and guidelines in many countries issued to regulate the activity that
surrounds virtual currencies, as well as digital tokens. To this extent, cryptocurrencies are not recognized by the laws of any countries in Southeast
Asia as legal tender. However, cryptocurrencies exchange platforms, as
well as platforms to facilitate ICO activity, are permitted in some countries
through the newly issued regulations/guidelines, along with the securities
laws.
To be more specific, different countries have different ways to regulate
ICO and cryptocurrency exchanges. To this extent, the main approaches
can be identified—the first applies ICO/cryptocurrency-related activity to
the existing securities Law. This can be seen in Singapore, where there
are currently no bespoke regulations to supervise crypto-asset-related
activities, although several existing regulations may apply. The second is
applying newly issued laws/regulations to these activities.
However, these two approaches are generally similar in terms of the
requirements set for both cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO platforms.
For example, under the Royal Decree on Digital Asset Businesses of Thailand, the Royal Decree sets out requirements for an operating licence
the platforms must obtain to legally conduct their activities if digital
tokens/cryptocurrencies fall within the scope of the outlined restrictions
(security token). This is similar to what is prescribed in the Securities

Law of Singapore (the Securities and Future Act (SFA)) for the requirement with regard to capital market products (Section 2(1) of the SFA)42
and the CMS licence. To this extent, with regard to the regulatory
approach to ICOs/cryptocurrency exchanges in Singapore, the Securities and Future Act (SFA) is the governing law to be considered along
with a guideline issued by MAS. To be more specific, MAS expressed that
if digital tokens traded on any digital token exchange platforms are securities, future contracts or other types of capital market products under
Section 2(1) of the SFA, the exchanges must receive authorization from
MAS before acting as platforms to accommodate such activity.43
However, there are also differences under Thai and Singapore regulations. This can refer to the sixth case study given in the Guide to Digital
Token Offerings issued by MAS, that a virtual currency exchange platform
that wishes to allow users to exchange virtual currencies to fiat currencies
is currently not regulated by MAS.44
In Malaysia, the Capital Markets and Services (Prescription of Securities) (Digital Currency and Digital Token) Order 2019 came into force
on January 15, 2019. This order set an authorization requirement for
digital asset platform operators. In particular, the Malaysia SC requires
a digital asset platform to apply to the SC to be registered/authorized
under the revised guidelines. However, with regard to ICOs, MS stated
that the guidelines for ICOs will be issued by the end of Q1 of 2019.45
At present, other ASEAN countries, namely Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Myanmar and Vietnam, still have no laws and regulations specifically
designed to regulate either cryptocurrency exchange platforms or platforms for ICO-related activity; however, regulators in these countries may
apply existing relevant regulations in such cases. Of these countries, there
are also attempts to find proper regulatory approaches to address this

development of technology; for instance, in Vietnam, the Ministry of
Justice is reviewing existing laws on the management of virtual assets and
currencies in the country.
To summarize, cryptocurrencies are not recognized by the law of
any Southeast Asian countries as legal tender. However, cryptocurrency exchange platforms, as well as platforms to facilitate ICO activity,
are permitted in some countries through the newly issued regulations/guidelines and/or the Securities Law.

Conclusion
Digital technology diffusion requires sufficient infrastructure, a thriving
entrepreneurial ecosystem, and a favourable legal and regulatory framework. Many countries in ASEAN have put in place a fundamental digital
infrastructure to support their digital economy. The presence of digital
entrepreneurs can encourage the adoption of digital technologies by
driving down costs and raising quality, reinforcing market demand (for
example, via intelligent automation, cloud technology, or software as a
service), and putting pressure on incumbents to keep up. The digital
innovation ecosystem in emerging or less-developed nations, on the other
hand, is still small in contrast, with just a few local and international digital
solution companies compared to the size of the countries’ economies. For
instance, compared to its regional counterparts, Thailand exhibits relative
underdevelopment in five complex B2B sectors, indicating considerable
potential. Mobility tech, big data and analytics, health tech, digital media
and entertainment tech are some industries. There are several explanations
for Thailand’s limited funding flow into these industries.
Regarding regulatory constraints, overall, for ASEAN member states,
lacking regulatory support and over-regulation problems are two of the
main issues that regulators should take into account when regulating
FinTech businesses. Lessons learned from different jurisdictions reflect
these two problems in various FinTech companies. Many of Southeast
Asian countries have an innovation-stifling environment with high regulatory compliance costs, poor de-facto enforcement, and a vicious cycle
of heavy regulation due to their view of excessive risks in the digital
ecosystem.
While regulators in Southeast Asian countries are receptive to emerging
financial services technologies, poor infrastructure has undoubtedly
obstructed them in supporting FinTech in practice.

6

DIGITAL ASSETS AND CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY IN ASEAN

115

In addition, for regulators in Southeast Asia that have put effort into
addressing such technology developments, the regulatory environment
in some countries is still not sufficient to support this. For instance,
the Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations in many countries are still
limited to face-to-face identity verification, which does not correspond
to FinTech business models. The different standard of data protection is
another concern for regulators due to some categories of FinTech businesses being necessary to deal with the cross-border transfer of data,
which creates difficulty for such businesses if the standard of data protection between two (or more) countries is not the same. This also reflects
regulatory harmonization challenges at the regional level.
On the other hand, it is also possible for a country that issued bespoke
regulations to over-regulate FinTech businesses if they cannot set the
optimal balance between market simulation and risk management.
To conclude, regarding digital assets (and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which is a part of digital assets) regulations, one of the most
significant issues confronting domestic regulatory approaches on digital
assets is that various authorities have differing attitudes on the usage of
cryptocurrencies. These conflicting positions, as well as a lack of communication among various organizations, may pose challenges in the usage
and oversight of cryptocurrencies.
For example, several countries have their own legislation for ICOs;
nonetheless, it remains difficult for authorities to give clear-cut guidance
and/or subordinate regulations, such as the criteria for distinguishing
utility and security tokens.
Furthermore, additional difficult legal concerns for which there is yet
no legislative backing, such as the validity of so-called “smart contracts”
and law enforcement or the seizure of cryptocurrencies, may develop as a
result of aspects of digital assets and DLT.

Cryptocurrency, Stablecoins, and Blockchain
Pawee Jenweeranon

Introduction
The varied features of digital assets, from security to non-security tokens,
lead to complexities from a regulatory standpoint. A token’s legal status
depends on its main function or the type of token being considered;
accordingly, the tokens’ categories are helpful for capturing the complexities of digital assets and to guiding effective regulatory responses. In other
words, the complexity of the structure of digital assets has led to concerns
from regulators and all relevant stakeholders, such as consumer risk and
money laundering concerns.
The main focus of this chapter is to differentiate “crypto assets” from
“digital assets” in the blockchain ecosystem. With respect to this, for the
reason that there are many terms that are used interchangeably, it should
be emphasized that this chapter analyses “crypto assets” as a subset of
“digital assets”; “digital assets have a broader definition than “crypto
assets”, “digital tokens”, “private digital tokens”, or “cryptocurrencies”.

This chapter aims to catalogue the main types of crypto assets in
the market as is necessary for the regulatory analysis that follows in
later chapters. This is because the analysis in the subsequent chapters
aims to identify regulatory gaps. Hence, it is important to understand
the arrangements of such assets, which could otherwise fall outside
the scope of existing legal and regulatory frameworks. For example, in
order to understand the characteristics of crypto assets referencing one
fiat currency, it is necessary to differentiate this type of crypto asset
from electronic money and to correspondingly propose sound regulatory responses. Accordingly, the chapter classifies types of digital assets
according to their functions, features, creation, and initial distribution.
In general, all related terms, from digital assets, to crypto assets, to
cryptocurrencies, have been differentially defined from one country to
another. Moreover, in some states, the existing taxonomies of these terms
have failed to fully capture the terms’ relevant features.1 It is therefore
necessary to differentiate the scope of all of these terms, as this will
be helpful for capturing the proper regulatory responses. In addition to
this, regulations, government documents, and working papers, as well as
research/industry reports that describe these terms will be discussed.
To exemplify this, the relevant terms are defined in the Regulation
of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Cryptoassets, and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937, in particular, in which
“crypto-asset” is broadly defined as a digital representation of value or
rights that utilizes distributed ledger technology or similar.2 This is similar
to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which draws a clear
distinction between two key terms, namely digital assets and crypto assets.
In particular, the novel characteristics of crypto assets make them differ
from digital ones. These distinct characteristics include the non-necessity

of a formal issuer and the incentive model derived from its underlying
distributed ledger technology.3
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the UK also specified in
their guidance on crypto assets that there is no universal definition for the
term; however, the FCA considered crypto assets to be “a cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights”. The
definitions can reflect the similar ways of interpretation of the term crypto
assets, in that all the interpretations highlighted the use of cryptographic
techniques. Furthermore, apart from the common way of interpretation,
it should be noted that some propose that the term crypto assets should
be defined as widely as possible. This is to cover all types of crypto assets
in the market.4
The emergence of the crypto asset concept led to widespread discussions of regulatory support mechanisms. This is because its characteristics
can be complex and different from regulated substances within the
scope of existing regulatory frameworks. Accordingly, this chapter aims
to explore the different features of the main types of crypto assets or
blockchain-based digital assets in the market. The chapter does not cover
all types of digital objects or assets, such as in-game objects. Additionally,
it should be noted that this chapter does not cover the so-called Central
Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The Bank of International Settlement
also states that CBDCs differ from crypto assets in general,5 whereas
others might consider CBDCs a type of crypto asset or price-stable forms
thereof.6
To briefly summarize, many countries still lack a clear regulatory basis
for certain types of crypto assets due to their complicated structure. To
supplement, according to existing regulatory frameworks, crypto assets

may not be possible to consider as fiat money.7 This is because existing
legislation remains narrow with respect to the definition of state currency,
as well as some crypto assets having an unstable price or value. With
respect to this, crypto assets may fall within the terminology of property
referring to the legal statement proposed by the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce of Lawtech8 ; however, a regulatory basis continues to lack in many
other countries.

General Definition: International
and Domestic Dialogues
As noted earlier, there are many approaches to classifying the types of
crypto assets in the market. The general classification should be financial
and non-financial asset-type crypto assets. To this, as per the general definitions provided, crypto assets constitute an umbrella term that includes
various kinds of sub-categories. To better understand the outline of crypto
asset classifications, this thesis explores the ways in which crypto assets
are categorized by international organizations. This is because standardsetting by these may be helpful in identifying the most suitable structure
within the scope of this study.
The European Commission classifies crypto assets into three main
types—utility tokens, asset-referenced tokens, and E-money tokens.
The European Commission also differentiates different types of crypto
assets in its Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on Markets in Crypto-Assets and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937 (MiCA).9 However, the European Banking

Authority (EBA) provides a taxonomy of crypto assets that includes
payment/exchange/currency tokens, investment tokens, and utility
tokens.10 It is interesting to note that the European Central Bank developed the so-called crypto cube to identify different classes of crypto
assets. The crypto cube assessment focuses on certain criteria, such as
the existence/absence of the issuer, the decentralization/centralization of
responsibilities and what underpins the value of such assets.11
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSO)
cited three main types of crypto assets, namely security, utility and
payment/exchange/currency tokens. However, the IOSO emphasizes
that a case-by-case assessment is needed. This reflects the fact that a clear
distinction for various types of digital tokens may need to come with
the assessment guidelines, as it could be difficult to ascertain consistency
when exercising discretion.12
On the other hand, private sector actors may consider classes of crypto
assets differently than those given by international entities. The types can
be identified as payment tokens (such as cryptocurrencies), financial asset
tokens, and consumer tokens.13
It should be noted that different entities have different approaches to
the labelling of different categories of crypto assets; however, most entities
share the common consideration that the categorization of crypto assets
shall rely on their main functions and features. From the hybrid features of
a number of tokens in the market, the classification of such crypto assets is
not always as straightforward as has been proposed by the research team

at the CCAF.14 This is similar to what was addressed in the report by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which noted that “the definition is
far from globally uniform…”.
To exemplify this, the complexation of crypto asset characteristics can
be seen in the arrangement of the so-called stablecoins, which are a
subtype of crypto asset. In particular, a stablecoin is a type of crypto
asset that features some stablilization mechanisms. However, the term
stablecoin lacks a universal definition.15
According to the publication of the European Central Bank (ECB),
stablecoins can be classified into fiat-backed stablecoins (tokenized funds).
Tether, which is the oldest and most utilized stablecoin, represents this
type. The second type is collateralized stablecoins, or collaterally backed
stablecoins that differ from tokenized funds or fiat-backed stablecoins,
as this type of stablecoin is backed by assets. There are also other types
of stablecoins that will be discussed herein, such as off-chain collateralized stablecoins, on-chain collateralized stablecoins, and algorithmic
stablecoins.
At the domestic level, in terms of crypto asset classification, many
countries prioritize the assets’ main characteristics and economic purpose
as their main considerations. For instance, FINMA classifies crypto assets
into three main types—payment, utility, and asset tokens.16 However, it
also identifies the existence of hybrid tokens.17
It is necessary to understand the core concepts and features of the
main types of crypto assets in order to understand the regulatory and
supervisory implications. This study aims to propose an accommodative
framework that potentially fills existing regulatory gaps. The framework
should be helpful in supporting asset tokenization in relevant industries.

Accordingly, it is important to analyse samples of crypto assets in the
market in order to understand their arrangements.

Basic Characteristics of Crypto Assets
Tokens are the general term for value units in a blockchain system. There
were about 11,000 distinctive kinds of tokens by the end of 2021.18
Conceptually, this segment classifies crypto assets in the market into
specific types—security, utility, payment/currency, and hybrid tokens.
Accordingly, the selection of tokens in this section is based on different
features of each token that represent different arrangements. This part
does not cover all possible types of crypto assets in the market; however,
the analysis of certain types of tokens would help illuminate the complex
arrangements of crypto assets that lead to regulatory concerns.
To this, this section adds the basic principle of key factors, including
money, currency, and securities in brief. The outline constitutes a framework for analysing the arrangements of selected crypto assets or tokens
that could be helpful for regulatory analysis in the following chapters. This
section will further address general explanations of the various categories
of tokens.
Money/Currency Characteristics
A currency typically performs, or should fulfil, three fundamental functions, known as primary monetary functions in the terminology of
monetary theory19 : (1) The medium of exchange function: A currency
is a means of exchange that facilitates the exchange of goods and services.
(2) Store of value function: A currency acts as a store of value, allowing
its worth to be preserved for an indefinite length of time. (3) Unit of
account function: A currency is a unit of account that may be used to
represent the value of a product or service.
Additionally, it is possible to derive additional characteristics of currencies based on the three primary monetary functions, which are referred
to as secondary monetary functions. On the one hand, these define the

features of a currency in greater depth, but they are also essential to
the basic monetary functions to be fulfilled. Furthermore, supplementary
monetary functions offer a more accurate assessment of crypto assets in
terms of the currency question.
For instance, to this, it is beneficial in the short run and essential
in the long term for a currency to be simple to handle and highly
transportable for it to have utility as a method of payment. This is
especially true for transactions involving significant sums of money or
a large number of currencies. Ease of handling and transportability
are particularly important for transactions that take place across great
distances.
Another prerequisite—at least on a local or regional level—is
widespread currency adoption in business and, more broadly, amongst the
public. Only if a significant number of places accept the currency in return
for products, services, or debt settlement will it eventually fulfil its role as
a means of payment. A (positive) network externality or network effect is
a term used in economics to describe this occurrence.20 The greater the
advantage for all network members, the larger the (currency) network.
Only when a sufficient number of network participants are present21 —in
the case of a currency, the number of people and businesses who accept
it—does the currency meet the above-mentioned criteria for acting as a
means of exchange and payment.
Furthermore, in order to fulfil the store-of-value purpose, a currency
must exhibit price stability in addition to physical or digital storage and
durability criteria. The value of the currency should therefore only vary to
a limited degree over time, with minor inflationary (reduction in value and
therefore a decrease in buying power) or deflationary (increase in value
and thus an increase in purchasing power) tendencies. The population’s
belief that a currency’s future buying power will be essentially the same
as today’s lies at the heart of the store-of-value function. Confidence in
a currency may rapidly deteriorate if the store-of-value function is not
met, as is the case in periods of hyperinflation. As a result, the other two

Network Industries (2001), 104, 113.

monetary functions—medium of exchange and unit of account—will be
only partially fulfilled.
Price stability, on the other hand, is not only essential for the store-ofvalue function but also plays a crucial role in the performance of the unit
of account function. Indeed, if the currency’s price volatility necessitates
regular price changes in order to guarantee an accurate representation of
value, displaying the pricing of goods and services in units of this currency
only makes limited sense. It is also debatable whether displaying pricing
in this currency is helpful if it is not commonly used and only has limited
acceptability.
A currency’s fungibility is a crucial condition for performing the
value-measuring function, in addition to characteristics such as high
acceptability and price stability. In this sense, fungibility refers to the
characteristic that any physical or digital unit of a currency has the same
nominal value as any other unit of the same currency. This means that
variations in individual currency units, such as age or past owners, have no
effect on their value. A fungible form of money, in other words, is memoryless. If a money is not fungible, it requires a lot more work to utilize
it as a unit of account. In order to estimate the value of a given set of
currency units, for example, one must not only count the quantity of the
currency units provided but also identify the additional value-determining
dimensions and account for these appropriately. A currency whose fungibility cannot be guaranteed is only appropriate to a limited degree for
use as a unit of account or for assessing the value of other things, as this
entails significant search and transaction costs.
Additionally, it should be worth considering that, as of today, many
currencies have no or just a very low underlying (material) value that
differs significantly from their nominal one. As a result, a fiat currency’s
value is solely determined by the advantages generated by the monetary
functions specified above. To put it another way, a currency must not have
an intrinsic value in undertaking monetary functions.
Security Characteristics
To determine whether such crypto assets shall be regarded as securities
or not, this section explores some common features of securities by referring to some selected countries’ regulatory frameworks. The question of
whether the crypto asset constitutes a “security” under those regulations
is a critical one.

126

P. JENWEERANON

To exemplify this, this section briefly analyses US federal securities laws.
An “investment contract”, as well as other instruments such as stocks,
bonds, and transferable shares, are all considered “securities”. A crypto
asset should be examined to determine whether it contains the features of
any product that satisfies the federal securities laws’ definition of a “security”. The Howey decision and subsequent case law of the United States
Supreme Court have determined that an “investment contract” arises
when money is invested in a joint business with a reasonable expectation
of benefit accruing from the efforts of others.22
Moreover, the SEC released a “Framework for ‘Investment Contract’
Analysis of Digital Assets” on April 3, 2019, in an effort to offer clarification.23 This approach is encouraging, as it demonstrates that the Securities and Exchange Commission is prepared to exclude some blockchainbased digital assets from being regarded as securities. Although the advice
is an improvement over the abysmal uncertainty that currently exists in
this area, it is no replacement for unambiguous law and court decisions.
According to the above-mentioned framework, the key question when
applying the Howey test to a digital/crypto asset is whether the buyer
has a reasonable expectation of profit (or other financial rewards) arising
from the labour of others. Participating in dividends or other means of
achieving asset appreciation, such as selling at a profit in the secondary
market, may be expected to provide a return to a buyer.24 The “economic
reality”25 of the transaction, as well as “what character the instrument is
given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan of distribution,
and the economic inducements held out to the prospect”, are all relevant to this investigation.26 As a result, the analysis is objective, focusing
on the transaction itself and how the digital/crypto asset is offered and

sold.27 To this, relevant laws and regulations will be discussed herein in
the subsequent chapters.
It is worth pointing out that “reasonable expectation of profits” is a key
characteristic of “securities” subjected to the Howey test.28 In the case of
crypto assets, when assessing one, it is important to evaluate if there is
a realistic expectation of profit. Profits may include, for example, capital
appreciation from the growth of the original investment or commercial
operation, as well as a share of profits from the use of buyers’ money.29
The Howey test does not regard price appreciation resulting simply
from external market factors (such as general inflationary trends or the
economy) that affect the supply and demand for an underlying product
to be “profit”. This is significant in assessing security characteristics of
such crypto assets in the market. The security characteristics may link to
tokens that can be used for investment purposes (investment tokens).
Property Characteristics
Conceptually, the phrase “digital asset” encompasses a broader spectrum
of electronic, and therefore more intangible, assets than conventional
conceptions of property. Furthermore, with respect to the definition
proposed by the Bank of International Settlement (BIS), crypto assets
are private digital assets that rely on cryptography and distributed ledgers
or comparable technologies to function. To this, crypto assets are digital
assets that appear in an intangible form.
As a result, in particular, in the case of digital/crypto assets, there are
distinct legal concerns to take into account. Even if the token does not
reflect rights in a physical asset or rights against a counterparty, it is generally believed that the token may be regarded as an object of property
rights in the case of crypto assets. Although many legal systems regard
some rights (i.e., rights in rem) as objects of property rights, they may
not fully recognize intangible elements as constituting appropriate objects

across all property rights. This can be seen in the civil and commercial laws
of many jurisdictions. In this context, ownership is an especially difficult
issue. This is known as the “property issue” and it comes down to whether
or not any particular legal system can incorporate “digital commodities”.
The author will address all relevant legal and regulatory unclarities in the
chapter containing the legal and regulatory analysis.30
The issue is somewhat simpler in the case of digital assets, as many
legal systems regard certain rights as intangible objects of property rights
(i.e., res incorporales). However, as many of these legal systems concentrate on the paper representation of the res incorporales, the property
issue persists: paper certificate offer a physical, moveable res that is a suitable object of property rights. In order to make the pre-DLT system of
dematerialized business shares function, certain systems require a (paper)
worldwide certificate in a vault. When the paper is removed, the property
issue arises for all digital assets in such systems.31
Drawing on money/currency, security, and property characteristics, to
summarize, it is necessary to understand these characteristics in order to
appropriately categorize different types of tokens in the market. Conceptually, money is an economic unit that functions as a means of payment,
a unit of account, and a store of value, whereas securities are a negotiable
financial instrument that represents financial value in the form of treasury bills, bonds, shares, debentures, or any other instruments specified
by securities laws.32 However, it is not easy to provide clarity in determining which digital/crypto assets are legal tender, money, securities, or
utilities. The following comprise the main types of tokens based on their
respective objective functions.

General Types of Crypto Assets
In order to apply all of the above characteristics to particular types of
crypto assets or tokens, this section further specifies the categorization of
crypto assets as follows:

Private Tokens/Coins
Payment Tokens
To this, further to the currency characteristics as mentioned earlier, the
primary purpose of currency tokens (also known as payment tokens) is
to be used as a mode of payment. A central authority may issue these.
Currency tokens, on the other hand, are often built on a separate, decentralized blockchain that does not feature a central counterparty. They do
not have any inherent value.33 Currency tokens, on the other hand, are
exchanged at a particular price because other market actors assign a monetary value to the tokens based on the limited amount of tokens encoded
in the code and the blockchain’s anti-counterfeiting security features.34
Securities Tokens
An investment token may provide the opportunity to benefit l the issuer’s
future profits, the right to receive fixed payments, or voting rights.35 It
is usually not sufficient for a token to be classed as an investment token
if its investment component entirely depends on expected gains on the
secondary market (that is, the possibility of selling the token for a greater
price than that for which it was purchased). Aside from that, virtually
every token would be considered an investment token.
Investment tokens may also be linked to a company’s shares, in which
case they are referred to as equity tokens. As a result, a company’s shares
may be transferred to a third party that will keep them safe. Ownership
of the token in this configuration entails a “claim” against the custodial
third party for “surrender” of the share and “assignment” of any rights
arising from it. Alternatively, business shares may be directly tokenized;
that is, the company’s stock may be stored and sold on the blockchain.
The feasibility of this strategy is a function of national corporate laws.
A debt token is defined as an investment token that represents the
right of the token holder to periodic fixed or variable payments and is

structured similarly to a bond. It is also known as a security token and
refers to tokens that are compliant with securities laws.
Utility Tokens
Utility tokens represent a claim or entitlement to a certain level of performance by the issuer. As a result, they resemble a digital coupon. The
holder of a utility token may exchange it for the product or service
associated with the token with the issuing business. This category of
goods and services includes, for example, the supply of storage space,36
restaurant meals, and the usage of promotional services.37 The architecture of a utility token is entirely determined by the token’s issuer.
Secondary market trades are also possible using utility tokens. However,
their tradability and potential profit expectations have no bearing on their
categorization as utility tokens.
The issuer may re-issue a utility token if a token holder redeems it.
Alternatively, he or she may burn something. The token is permanently
removed from the blockchain as a result of this action and its status as a
unit of value is thus permanently lost.
In other words, utility tokens are a type of digital voucher that may be
used to purchase products or services.38 They also represent the issuer and
purchaser’s rights and responsibilities. The issuer guarantees the buyer a
future service, which may be stated in a white paper or in the terms of
service. As a result, the conventional paper voucher is classified as a “carrier instrument” or “bearer token” under section 807 BGB.39 Gift cards
that are charged electronically are likewise subject to this judgement.40
When redeeming the token, the issuer promises a service or the delivery
of commodities. In the case of tokens, however, owing to the absence of
a certificate, the transfer of this value is more complicated. Although the
(voucher) data is stored on gift cards, tangibility is achieved.41 Tokens,

on the other hand, are intangible. As a result, tokens have no legal status
and only serve to symbolize the underlying rights.42
Filecoin is one example of a utility token. The project team was able
to generate $257 million via token sales. The decentralized cloud storage
platform for Filecoin is also accessible to token-holders. In other words,
Filecoin constitutes a decentralized data storage marketplace, protocol,
and cryptocurrency that is making the internet safer and more efficient.43
Asset-Backed Tokens
Apart from the types of tokens mentioned above, there is a category of
token that significantly relates to asset tokenization due to its characteristics. In the market, there are tokens that are directly connected to a real
asset—amongst the many token types. Asset-backed tokens are a subset
class and tokenization is the process of connecting a real item to a virtual
token. The holder of an asset-backed token has the right to recover the
connected item from the entity holding it on a regular basis by “redeeming” the token.44 Custodianship is often performed by the token issuer.
One actual item is sometimes connected to a specific number of tokens.
Works of art or real estate, for example, may be tokenized in this manner.
An equity token is one that is tied to a company’s stock. Such a token may
also be linked to precious metals or other valued items. The low volatility
of asset-backed currency tokens makes them especially suited as a method
of value storage. The issue with asset-backed coins is that they are seldom
guaranteed to have adequate coverage.
Privacy Coins
Privacy coins are a type of cryptocurrency that enables private and anonymous blockchain transactions to be conducted by concealing the origins
and destinations thereof. In order to avoid chain analysis, the methods

employed include concealing a user’s actual wallet balance and address
and mixing numerous transactions with one another.
In the spirit of openness, Bitcoin and other non-private blockchains
enable anyone to see public addresses and transactions on their networks,
making it very easy to trace a user’s deposits and withdrawals. Privacy
coins, on the other hand, encompass two distinct aspects: anonymity and
untraceability. Anonymity conceals the identity of the person making the
transaction, whereas untraceability makes it almost impossible for other
parties to follow the trail of transactions using services like blockchain
analysis.45 This research explores the two main types of privacy coins
below.
Governance Tokens
Developers build governance tokens to enable token-holders to help influence the future of a system. Governance token-holders have the ability to
influence project choices, such as submitting and voting on new feature
ideas, as well as altering the governance structure itself.
In many instances, smart contracts instantly apply the modifications
made, reviewed, and voted on via on-chain governance that is accessible
through governance tokens. In other instances, the project’s maintenance staff is charged with implementing the modifications or recruiting
someone to do so. Proponents of governance token-based systems argue
that they provide user control, which is consistent with the original
cryptocurrency goals of decentralization and democracy. Decentralized
autonomous organizations (DAOs) allow users to direct the evolution
of their systems.
Maker (MKR) is a well-known example of a governance token. Its
holders may vote on decisions relating to the decentralized finance (DeFi)
system, which the decentralized stablecoin DAI utilizes. MKR holders, for
example, may vote to alter the complex economic laws that govern decentralized lending, allowing DAI to maintain its price stability. MKR holders
were also voting on whether the protocol’s debt limit should be increased
at the time the content of this paper was published.
According to the Coingecko website, top governance coins can
be delineated by market capitalization. These include Uniswap,
PancakeSwap, Aave, Amp, Maker, etc.

Stablecoins
Conceptually, stable coins are designed to decrease the significant price
fluctuation seen in Bitcoin and other crypto assets, as this volatility
is considered the primary barrier to their broad adoption and use as
payment methods. The US Dollar Tether is the most well-known example
of a stable coin (USDT). The stable coin is a type of asset-backed token.
Such currency tokens are known as stable coins. The Tether token,
for example, is pegged to the US dollar. As a result, its exchange rate
fluctuates minimally around the dollar.
The European Central Bank defines stablecoins as “…digital units of
value designed to minimize fluctuations in their prices against a reference
currencies or basket of currencies…”; this statement reflects the fact that
stablecoins are primarily intended to prevent volatile price fluctuations.
However, stablecoins are a broad term that could encompass various
arrangements. To this, types of references can include fiat currencies,
physical gold, and other types of assets.46
Given its characteristics, many countries realized the benefits of stablecoins and aimed to put in place proper regulatory instruments to support
their utilization while mitigating potential risks. Stablecoins are a type
of digital asset that is intended to be accepted as a method of payment
for online transactions (“ecommerce”), peer-to-peer and micro-payments,
and a variety of other possible future uses. They also have the potential
to be used as a digital monetary instrument in DLT applications, such as
programmable money or smart contracts.47
For instance, according to a publication by the G7 Working Group on
Stablecoins, they could contribute to the development of an international
payment system. Given their characteristics and underlying technology,
stablecoins can offer faster, less expensive payment options.48
However, although stablecoins offer a variety of benefits, there are
also challenges and risks that should be considered in developing their

ecosystem. These can include the lack of clarity of a regulatory framework in relation to the legal status of stablecoins. In this regard, a proper
legal foundation for stablecoin arrangements is required.
It is vital to understand the main functions, features, and common
types of stablecoins to analyse the most suitable regulatory framework
to apply in their case. The most common types of stablecoins are fiatcollateralized, crypto-collateralized, and non-collateralized varieties.49 To
be more specific, stablecoins can be categorized into three main types
depending on the underlying collateralized assets. This feature of stablecoins was developed to stabilize their price, as it tied in with the value of
the underlying assets, as noted earlier.
In relation to asset tokenization, according to Jeremy Allaire, CEO and
creator of Circle Internet Financial, stablecoins will play a significant role
in the tokenizing of assets—converting assets in the form of tokens into
a blockchain. He conveyed this at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, on Tuesday (21/01) at the session “From tokenized assets
to a tokenized economy50 ”.
Hybrid Tokens
As tokens may have a wide range of characteristics and purposes, hybrid
forms emerge. In these instances, the categorization must be made on the
basis of the actual characteristics of the individual token while remaining
within the bounds of the applicable legal rule. Furthermore, it is important to note that there are other tokens that cannot be classified into any
of the aforementioned categories.

publication, changes in payments, banking, and technology, as well as
the disruption accelerated by Covid-19, have attracted attention at the
CBDC. It is interesting to note that key statistics produced by the BIS

reflect the interests of the CBDC. As per its name, central bank digital
currencies are an electronic form of central bank money or a digital
banknote. Accordingly, a digital banknote can be used by individuals in
any transactions (so-called retail CBDC) or amongst financial institutions
for interbank transfers (so-called wholesale CBDC).
In terms of features, CBDC can be categorized into different groups
of other crypto assets in the market. With respect to this, a snapshot of a
taxonomy of crypto assets developed by the European Parliament reflects
the difference between CBDCs and other private crypto assets.51
Additionally, in a statement, the Bank of England noted that, in principle, the Bank supplies real money in the form of banknotes that may
be used to make payments by both individuals and companies. Electronic
money is also available, although it can only be utilized by banks and
certain financial organizations. Electronic money issued by the Bank of
England would thus be accessible to all families and companies through
a Central Bank Digital Currency. Anyone would then be able to make
electronic payments in central bank money, which would be allowed by
this.52 CBDC has the potential to expand payment options and the Bank’s
ability to keep pricing and the entire UK financial system stable. However,
it may also present difficulties that must be carefully handled. As a result,
we are studying CBDC and enlisting the help of experts both within and
outside the Bank. Our CBDC Discussion Paper for 2020 describes our
primary research topics, and our summary of replies to the Discussion
Paper summarizes the input we received.53
Moreover, the Bank of International Settlement states that some 50
central banks have previously published ideas or prototypes for central
bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Meanwhile, the media reports that
around 80% of central banks are seeking use cases for central bank

digital currencies (CBDCs), with 40% already putting proof-of-concept
programmes in place.54
However, the CBDC is not a major subject of this research. This is
because the study focuses on private types of crypto assets, particularly
those considered investment instruments. It is significant to understand
the difference between central bank and non-central bank money: CBDCs
differ from private crypto assets in that central bank money is provided as
a public good.55 However, CBDC will potentially take a leading role in
enhancing the financial infrastructure, for instance, in supporting multicurrency cross-border payments.

Analysis of Some Selected Tokens in the Market
Drawing on the previously-presented insights, this section aims to explain
different categories of crypto assets in the market. However, due to the
fact that there are many types thereof, this section will exemplify some
key types of crypto assets that attracted public attention and can be used
to represent different structures of such assets.
Bitcoin
Bitcoin (BTC) is a type of cryptocurrency that has gained substantial public attention in recent years. With respect to its characteristics,
Bitcoin could be considered a financial asset type or currency. In practice,
however, Bitcoin has the features of an investment instrument rather than
a means of payment, as it is volatile in price. To specify its initial features
as presented in its white paper,56 Satoshi Nakamoto aimed to use this
type of crypto currency to cut out the need for relevant intermediaries or
financial institutions in the payment process.

As per a general taxonomy of crypto assets – financial and non-financial
assets, in the white paper, Bitcoin is described as “a purely peer-to-peer
version of electronic cash”.57 Accordingly, it is more likely to initially
be designed to be a currency that falls under the scope of financial
assets. However, if we compare Bitcoin to national currencies, differences are apparent, such as its decentralized nature. This decentralization
also means that Bitcoin does not rely on the control of a Central Bank.
Because of this, and as Bitcoin is not produced by a Central Bank, no
country considers Bitcoin a legal tender under existing legislation. Other
differences include a fixed supply of Bitcoin (21,000,000 units).
Currency is traditionally created by a country’s government. For
example, the United States Treasury, via the United States Mint and
the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, creates the coins and notes that
its citizens use in their daily lives.58 The US’ central bank, the Federal
Reserve, then distributes money via the banking system. This money is
fiat money, which means that its value is not guaranteed by gold or any
other commodity.59 Rather, its worth is derived from the fact that it is
widely accepted as a form of payment. In other words, the way individuals utilize dollar notes and coins in the economy makes them valuable as
money.
As previously stated, in an economy, money has three purposes: it acts
as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. Money
must be accepted in exchange for goods and services in order to constitute an efficient medium of trade. Bitcoin may be used to buy and sell a
limited number of things. Although the number of businesses accepting
Bitcoin as payment has increased, these transactions still make up a small
proportion of the overall economy. Furthermore, although Bitcoin was
designed as a peer-to-peer payment system, many Bitcoin transactions
between consumers and businesses are facilitated by “middlemen” who

arrange the transactions by exchanging Bitcoin for traditional currencies.60 A transaction may be time- and resource-consuming; on average,
it takes 78 minutes to confirm a transaction (but it may take considerably longer) and it costs $28 to complete one.61 Furthermore, individuals
want a means of payment that retains its value over time (as compared
with services or a basket of goods). Bitcoin’s value, on the other hand,
has fluctuated over time.
In other words, it requires broad adoption in order to fulfil its role as
a medium of exchange and therefore as a method of payment. As a result,
it should not only be provided as a payment option by (online) shops and
businesses, but should also be utilized by the general public to pay for
purchases. However, there are currently a few businesses across the globe
that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. It should be emphasized though
that consumers only utilize it to a limited degree.62 The reasons for this
are many, and include the typically complex management of Bitcoin transactions, amongst others. In addition, the comparatively high transaction
fees for micro-payments and medium-sized transaction amounts, as well
as the—in comparison to other payment methods—lengthy time it takes
for a transaction to be verified on the blockchain all make it cumbersome
to use Bitcoin for daily transactions.
The stability of a money’s value is much more significant, as it can
thus act as a store of value. The value of Bitcoin has risen considerably
in recent years. When prices are increasing, variable prices may not seem
to be a danger to a money’s store-of-value function; nevertheless, when
prices are dropping, people are reminded that stable value is an essential
feature of any medium of value storage. According to economist Robert

Shiller, this volatility jeopardizes Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value
and is a key barrier to its adoption as a currency.63
Due to hacker attacks, thefts, and other security issues, the store-ofvalue function has been weakened.64 For example, hackers took down
Mt. Gox, the biggest Bitcoin exchange, in 2014, and 850,000 Bitcoins
(worth $14 billion at $17,000 apiece) were stolen at the time.65 Hackers
stole $70 million in Bitcoin on December 7, 2017. 66 Bitcoin owners are
unable to keep Bitcoins as a deposit in a bank; instead, they must store
them in a digital wallet, and such digital deposits are not protected by the
government in the same way that deposits at banks and credit unions are.
By definition, the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin and
many other crypto assets is a digital memory, with a storage function
that is especially effective owing to its decentralized nature. As a result,
crypto tokens in general and Bitcoin in particular ultimately meet the
required storage and durability criteria. In contrast to, or in conjunction
with, traditional (fiat) currencies, the key question is whether crypto assets
can maintain their value over longer periods of time.
Money is also used as a unit of account, or a standard for valuing
products and services. Retailers must periodically recalculate their Bitcoin
pricing, as Bitcoin values drastically change while the market is open
and from day to day, which is likely to mislead both buyers and sellers.
Furthermore, the price of Bitcoin swings on exchanges, and Bitcoin often
trades at various values on multiple exchanges, making pricing choices for
sellers even more difficult.67

Should we treat Bitcoin as a property? In an effort to answer these
questions, there have been discussions on these issues in recent years (citation needed). To exemplify this, the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) of
the US ruled that those virtual currencies should be treated as property
for tax purposes.68 In particular, the IRS provides that virtual currency
functions like real currency; however, it does not have legal tender status.
However, the clarification makes utilizing bitcoin as a currency more
problematic. For anyone who transacts in digital currencies will be subject
to the same record-keeping obligations and taxes as those who transact in
stocks and other financial instruments.69
Ethereum
Ethereum cryptocurrency (ETH) is a type of cryptocurrency. It is a digital
currency that can be used on the internet, and is comparable to Bitcoin.
Like other cryptocurrencies, one may transmit ETH without using a
third-party service such as a bank. It is the same as giving over cash in
person, except that it can be done with anybody, anywhere, at any time.
ETH is a decentralized and global cryptocurrency. This is because it is
built on Ethereum, which provides anyone, regardless of background or
location, with open access to digital money and other services.70
ETH has been widely used as an investment instrument like other
types of cryptocurrencies in the market. In this regard, analysing its
fundamental features or characteristics in terms of the above characteristics and types of tokens will not differ from the case of BTC, as
previously discussed. Specifically, in many respects, ETH and BTC are
similar: both are decentralized digital currencies that are exchanged on
internet exchanges and held in different kinds of cryptocurrency wallets.
This section considers ETH, as it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by
market capitalization. However, it should be noted that the fundamental

goal of ether is to make the Ethereum a smart contract and decentralized application (dapp) platform that is easier to use and commercialize.
This differs from the case of BTC, which was initially designed to be an
alternative to national currencies.
Monero
According to the Coindesk website, Monero is a cryptocurrency that
focuses on anonymity and was launched in 2014. It was forked from
Bytecoin by a user known as “Thankful for today” on the Bitcointalk
forum, and was subsequently maintained by the decentralized development community. Monero is fungible, which means that participation in
past transactions has no effect on the value of any given currency, since
the entire transaction history is unknown. Monero enables privacy and
prevents coins from being spent more than once by using senders’ unique
ring signatures, secret recipient addresses, and Ring Confidential Transactions.71 According to its white paper, the most significant features of this
digital money are “privacy and anonymity72 ”.
In other words, all transaction data are obscured, despite the fact that
it is a public and decentralized ledger. With Bitcoin, by contrast, all transaction information, user addresses, and wallet balances are made public
and accessible.
Zcash
According to its website, Zcash is a digital money that protects user
privacy and is based on sound science. People may trade quickly and
securely using it for a minimal charge. Shielded Zcash keeps transactions
private while enabling users to selectively disclose address and transaction
information for auditing or regulatory compliance purposes.73
In this, Monero and Zcash can be regarded as privacy coins. It should
be pointed out that privacy coins differ from other types of cryptocurrencies or crypto assets, as they are designed to be anonymous and

untraceable. However, it is worth pointing that to consider Monero and
Zcash as currencies, their values are set by demand and supply. Again,
similar to the case of other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, this is a key
barrier to its use as a currency in accordance with the main functions of
money (a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value).
To conclude, these features may not affect their legal status as a currency
according to three main aforementioned attributes; however, these may
embody the anonymity that this form of money provides.
Uniswap (UNI)
According to its website, UNI is a tradable asset that functions similarly
to most other ERC20 tokens, with the exception that it is more powerful
as a voting mechanism. The owner must first go through the delegation
procedure before using it as a vote. Delegating UNI ties one’s tokens’
voting power to an address that may then be used to vote. This address
can be private or that of a trustworthy third party a user thinks will vote
in Uniswap Governance’s best interests.74
Could a governance token be classified as a security? To begin with,
tokens are rarely utilized for public fundraising in today’s designs to
avoid being regarded as securities. Ordinary users acquire these tokens
by locking up money, providing liquidity, or recommending users on
the public side and they are typically given away for free. Ordinary users
do not obtain tokens via direct cash purchases, according to its general
design. However, Defi projects almost always have an initial investor.
Based on the original investor’s contribution, a portion of the token is
distributed to subsequent investors. Such a token purchase mechanism
satisfies Howey’s definition of investment. Additionally, despite the fact
that regular users acquire these tokens in a non-monetary manner, all
users have a clear expectation of appreciation, which is consistent with the
Howey Test’s definition of profit expectations. Furthermore, although the
use of DeFi does not require human participation or manual day-to-day
operation, these systems are created by specialized teams. Certain issuers’
papers state that some tokens can be saved for future workers, and that
the construction team would receive tokens in instalments. The Howey
Test concept of regular business is obviously met by such a business team.

It is also worth noting that governance tokens come with specific benefits. Protocols may charge their users a fee. Such fees are then collected
and a governance vote may determine whether a part of the fees should be
distributed to token-holders, similarly to how dividends are distributed in
stocks. As was previously stated, token owners have the right to vote on
the protocol’s future. Most projects, for example, permit token-holders
to vote on smart contract code modifications, as well as treasury management. Considerations for governance token qualifications as securities will
be discussed in detail in the following chapters.
Non-Fungible Tokens
The public’s interest in Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) was piqued in
February 2021 when a piece of video art sold for 6.6 million USD, and
it was piqued again in March when a collage of digital art created by the
same artist (who goes by the moniker Beeple) sold for 69 million USD.
Both transactions had one thing in common: the buyer did not attain any
real goods; instead, he received a crypto asset known as an NFT.
NFTs are one-of-a-kind; unlike money, they are not “fungible” or
interchangeable. An NFT attests to the asset’s ownership and may therefore be seen as a virtual certificate of authenticity. NFTs are now traded
in digital markets using cryptocurrency as a payment method and the
Ethereum blockchain as the preferred decentralized ledger.75
These features imbue them with a plethora of options. With the
assistance of smart contracts and metadata, the usage of NFTs on a
blockchain ensures ownership and provenance in an unbreakable way.
Transparency in ownership and transactions also eliminates issues that
may arise in non-virtual markets, such as art, jewellery, and real estate.
NFTs may furthermore eliminate the need for dealers and other types
of intermediaries, enabling buyers and sellers to retain a greater portion
of the transaction’s value. NFTs are also programmable and transferable,
allowing a piece of material to be enhanced or connected to other material by third parties after being uploaded to the blockchain. By integrating
it with additional material from the musical act, an NFT representing a

backstage pass at a performance, for example, may be made more valuable
or collectable.76
NFTs are also being used to trade a broad variety of virtual goods,
from NBA virtual trading cards to memes and tweets on the internet.
The token may be displayed on monitors or added to a virtual gallery
once it has been bought. There are hundreds of billions of dollars’
worth of yearly transactions in music, video games, and art that could
be tokenized, providing content-creators with greater power and value.
An NFT’s royalty may also potentially revert to the inventor each time it
is sold.77
Tether
According to the Tether white paper,78 Tether (known to all as USDT) is
a unit (or multiple units) of a fiat-pegged cryptocurrency issued by Tether
Limited. It should be noted that Tether Limited formerly incorrectly
stated that each token was backed by one US dollar.79 In principle, each
Tether unit, according to the company, is fully backed by USD reserves.
Tether supply would be determined by investor demand in this system,
with supply rising when investors deposit USD with Tether Inc and
decreasing when investors recover dollar deposits, thus removing Tether
from circulation. Conceptually, Tether differs from Bitcoin in terms of
having a more stable value. More importantly, by volume, in 2019 USDT
overtook Bitcoin as the most widely traded cryptocurrency.80
With respect to its characteristics, Tethers serve to provide liquidity
and are a well-known token that may be used to facilitate transactions
between other cryptocurrencies.
It should be noted that there is also the so-called “Tether Gold”
that was developed by the same operator. As its name implies, Tether

Gold is defined as a digital token that is backed by physical gold. In the
white paper, Tether Gold was described as an option for investors who
could be interested in investing in physical gold with lower costs. There
are differences between Tether and Tether Gold, such as the referenced
assets.81
Given the stable value of Tether, it is necessary to further consider its
legal status as a currency. As previously noted, the stability of money is
significantly important, as it serves as a store of value. In general, however,
it should be noted that the stable value of stablecoins depends heavily
on the type of such a stablecoin—they are presently classified as either
national fiat currency-backed, or cryptocurrency-backed, based on the
underlying collateral.
Some may argue that Tether’s false statement regarding its reserves82
could potentially affect its currency status. However, as previously noted,
a currency does not need to have an intrinsic value for undertaking
monetary functions.
Regarding its security characteristics, in the case of Tether, although
it is a type of cryptocurrency that is utilized by crypto investors who
wish to escape the high volatility of other cryptocurrencies while maintaining their value within the crypto market, Tether can be used as
an investment instrument because, unlike other cryptocurrencies in the
market, it has a high level of transparency and a low price fluctuation.
In this regard, it would be interesting to consider whether Tether should
constitute a security in light of its characteristics. To assess its security
features, it is necessary to understand investors’ reasonable expectation as
being a “reasonable expectation of profits” to be a key characteristic of
“securities”.
The later chapters will explore different regulatory implications based
on the different characteristics of these crypt assets. In this regard, the
chapters will address key concerns from regulators concerning the fact
that stablecoins may be susceptible to a bank run if a significant number
of investors hurry to redeem them, forcing sponsors to liquidate assets at

fire-sale prices and placing strain on the financial system. This concern led
to a proposal and discussion regarding more stringent rules.
STEEM Tokens
Conceptually, the STEEM blockchain saves information in an immutable
blockchain record and pays users in digital tokens called STEEM in
exchange for their efforts. The Steem blockchain creates fresh STEEM
coins every day and adds these to a community’s “rewards pool”. Users
are subsequently rewarded with tokens in exchange for their efforts,
which are determined by the number of votes their material receives.
Users with greater “STEEM Power” in their accounts are then able to
choose how a larger portion of the rewards pool is allocated.83

Regulatory Challenges
ASEAN Countries
Digital assets can be used in a variety of ways. To be more specific, this
depends on their main intended function or the type of token being
considered. For example, digital assets can be used as financial instruments
for businesses in the form of alternative fundraising channels. Accordingly, regulatory constraint is one of the key challenges for regulators in
the use of digital assets as a tool to boost financial inclusion in certain
jurisdictions. To date, there have been a number of legal problems that
may arise from the use of digital assets. These problems include a lack
of clarity in key regulatory frameworks, a lack of coordination amongst
authorities, information asymmetry, and issues relating to the ambiguous
legal rights and responsibilities of token issuers and token holders. Consequently, unless authorities put in place a suitable regulatory framework,
the benefits of digital assets may be undermined.
Specifically, it is worth noting that regulators in most ASEAN countries
are receptive to the changes. There are laws, regulations and guidance
that have been issued by regulators in order to support fast-growing
innovation while preventing potential risks. It is important to highlight that regulatory responses regarding crypto assets can generally be

categorized into three main types of regulatory responses: existing regulation; retrofitted regulation; and bespoke regulation.84 Most regulations
in ASEAN countries mainly regulated related activities and businesses
concerning digital assets.
In essence, regulators have to date focused on regulations for crypto
asset businesses, whose activities include initial coin offerings (ICOs).
However, the legal status of certain types of digital tokens remains
unclear, and are not properly regulated by regulations in a number of
ASEAN countries.
It is worth noting that to understand digital token categorization, it is
important for regulators and all stakeholders to implement laws and/or
regulations for such digital assets. This is also because digital assets can be
categorized into a variety of types, hence the differences that may fall
within the scope of different laws and/or regulations. More precisely,
a token’s legal treatment may depend on its main function or the type
of token being considered. The tokens’ categorizations are helpful for
capturing the complexities of crypto assets and in informing regulatory
responses in this rapidly evolving domain.
More specifically, digital tokens and cryptocurrencies can be considered types of digital assets. The types of digital assets primarily depend
on the assets’ functions and features. This can be explained by reference
to the functions and features of traditional financial instruments or financial assets, such as securities. For example, the security characteristics of
security (digital) tokens shall be considered in order to properly assess
the security of such tokens. However, there are other types of tokens,
including payment and utility tokens, which may fall within the scope of
a different regulatory framework. Furthermore, there are emerging new
types of digital assets such as “Libra coin” which was initially proposed as
“a simple global currency…”, it is obvious that the coin is aimed to be
used as a means of payment. This type of digital asset could be regarded
as a so-called stable coin. Also, there are a number of hybrid-type (digital)
tokens that could be difficult to group as any particular type of tokens,
and accordingly it is difficult for regulators to appropriately regulate such

tokens as well as related businesses and intermediaries. This can reflect
the regulatory challenges for regulators in ASEAN in ensuring laws and
regulations keep pace with the complexity of digital assets’ arrangement.
In other words, to contemplate a regulatory framework for digital assets,
there are a number of laws, regulations, and guidances that should be
taken into account as it is vital to understand the main functions, features,
and the common types of digital assets in order to analyse the most
suitable regulatory framework.
Regarding the regulatory challenges, as mentioned earlier, there is
regulatory uncertainty in a number of countries in Southeast Asia. For
example, in Indonesia, even there are new rules (Regulation No.5/2019)
allowing crypto assets to be traded as commodities on future exchanges in
the country; however, the regulation excludes initial coin offerings from
the scope of the regulation. This can reflect the regulatory uncertainty as
the regulation was not designed to support digital asset activities at full
scale. In addition, there is no regulation or guideline that was specifically
designed to ascertain the legal status of digital assets, including private
tokens. For instance, to consider whether such tokens are securities or
not.
Furthermore, to exemplify the regulatory challenges, it is notable that
the types of digital asset businesses under existing Thai laws and regulations are still limited and do not cover all possible types of digital asset
businesses in the market. At present, under the Emergency Decree on
Digital Asset Businesses, the types of digital asset businesses are limited
to three main types, namely exchange, brokerage, and dealer businesses.
In addition, the exemptions under the Notifications issued by the Thai
SEC are still limited and may need to be retrofitted in response to
emerging technologies. This can be seen as an insufficient standard to
ensure consumer protection.
For ICOs, there are bespoke regulations in Thailand as well as some
other countries for regulating ICO-related activities; however, it is still
challenging for regulators to provide clear-cut guidelines and/or subordinate regulations, such as the criteria to differentiate utility and security
tokens.
With regard to stable coins, it is noted that within the Thai legal
and regulatory framework, stable coins may not be granted the status
as a legal tender or currency. However, stable coins are a type of digital
asset that was defined in the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses. However, at present, it is worth noting that the Thai Securities and

7

CRYPTOCURRENCY, STABLECOINS, AND BLOCKCHAIN

149

Exchange Commission does not allow Libra to be traded as trading pairs.
In connection with the Notification KorTor11/2561, Thai SEC tends
to exempt businesses offering services in relation to the purchase or sale
of fiat-collateralized stable coins from the requirements specified in the
Emergency Decree. However, to date, the Thai SEC has only exempted
businesses offering services in relation to the purchase or sale of Thai
baht-collateralized stable coins. Therefore, in the case of Libra, regulatory
unclarity in Thailand may possibly impede its adoption and development
in the market.
There are also concerns associated with foreign business restrictions
and taxation: Under the Royal Decree and mandate of the Ministry
of Finance, businesses engaged in the digital asset trade must be registered as companies in Thailand. This restriction can potentially obstruct
foreign entities/investors from entering the Thai market as digital assetrelated businesses. This can also limit consumer choices. Moreover, it is
not consistent with the initiatives launched by the Thai government to
attract foreign investment in this area, as noted in a BOI announcement
in 2014.85
Regarding the implementation of regulations on capital gains tax,
under Thai laws, the Ministry of Finance issued ministerial regulations to
impose a 15% withholding tax on capital gains and benefits from digital
assets. This 15% tax rate could make the digital asset market in Thailand
less attractive for both Thai and foreign traders. Furthermore, there are
still many difficulties in terms of tax calculation.
In addition, with regards to the coordinated mechanisms, one of the
most significant difficulties confronting domestic regulatory perspectives
on the digital asset industry is that various authorities have differing views
on the usage of cryptocurrencies. These contradictory positions and a lack
of cooperation amongst various authorities may pose a difficulty in the
usage and monitoring of cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, additional complicated legal problems, such as the
validity of so-called “smart contracts” and law enforcement, or the seizure
of cryptocurrencies, may emerge as a result of characteristics of digital
assets and DLT.

In summary, there is regulatory unclarity concerning digital assets
which can potentially impede the utilization of digital assets at full scale.
Other Frontier Markets
Hong Kong SAR
In terms of the regulatory framework, Hong Kong’s fundamental legislation, in general, is based on free market principles, which are critical
for the country’s continued status as an international financial centre.
Regulatory responses to FinTech development, in this perspective, are
part of policy innovation targeted at market facilitation and other related
activities.
The legal status of crypto assets may differ depending on the primary
use or kind of crypto asset in question. Crypto asset classifications are
useful for expressing the intricacies of this asset class as well as directing
regulatory actions. The laws and regulations governing crypto assets in
Hong Kong are catalogued, compared, and evaluated in this chapter. A
thorough examination of the complex characteristics and functionalities
of crypto assets is required for this purpose, as is a grasp of the dangers
and regulatory consequences.
The SFC, Hong Kong’s territorial regulator, is in charge of crypto
assets. In theory, crypto assets or digital tokens are regulated by the SFC,
since some forms of crypto assets or digital tokens may be classified as
“securities” or “futures contracts” under the Securities and Futures Ordinance owing to their features (SFO). It is important to note that the SFC
is the primary regulatory and supervisory body for crypto asset activity.
The SFC, statements, and a position paper released by the institution are
also important controlling rules.
Certain types of crypto assets were regulated by existing securities
regulatory perimeters prior to the SFC’s statement on the regulatory
framework for virtual asset portfolio managers, fund distributors, and
trading platform operators, which was designed to prevent the risks associated with virtual asset investment. Before issuing the above-mentioned
statement, as well as a position paper in 2019, the SFC issued circulars to
clarify its regulatory stances, including a statement on initial coin offerings (ICOs), a circular to licensed corporations and registered institutions
on Bitcoin futures contracts, and a circular to licensed corporations and

7

CRYPTOCURRENCY, STABLECOINS, AND BLOCKCHAIN

151

registered institutions on cryptocurrency-related investment products in
2017.86
Furthermore, the ICO statement87 underlines that a digital token may
be considered a security under Hong Kong’s current regulatory framework. Furthermore, the ICO’s digital tokens may constitute a share, a
debenture, or an interest in a collective investment scheme (CIS) based on
their characteristics and what the tokens represent, according to the ICO’s
statement on ICOs. To provide an example, if a digital token represents
an ownership stake in a company, it will be treated as a share. The tokens
should be treated as a debenture if they are used to recognize a debt or
obligation. Furthermore, tokens might be seen to have an interest in a
CIS if they offer token holders with a portion of the project’s earnings.
To conclude, the rights linked to such digital tokens must be considered
in order to establish which form of financial instrument they are. It should
be emphasized that under Hong Kong securities legislation, all potential
forms of financial instruments are deemed “securities”.
In Hong Kong, however, cryptocurrencies are not legal currency, since
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) specifies three characteristics of money. To begin with, cryptocurrencies are not frequently
recognized as a form of payment. This is seen in the instance of Bitcoin, a
sort of digital money whose value has fluctuated. Cryptocurrency price
fluctuations have the potential to make them unusable as a means of
trade. The HKMA also said that Bitcoin is a “highly inefficient mode
of payment” due to a number of factors, including its lengthy validation procedure. Furthermore, as is typical with cryptocurrencies, its value
has been exclusively determined by market demand and supply. This trait
makes adopting cryptocurrency as a store of value or a unit of account
difficult for key stakeholders. Furthermore, according to the HKMA’s
proposed “moneyness” addition specification, cryptocurrencies are not
scalable, and hence do not fulfil the ultimate condition of forming money
or legal tender.

In general, this is consistent with how countries around the world have
approached the legal status of cryptocurrencies; for example, the Bank
of Thailand issued a notification in 2018 clarifying that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender under Thai law (the Currency Act B.E.2501
(1958)), or Bank Negara Malaysia issued a policy document declaring
that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in the country.88
It’s worth noting that the HKMA focuses on the legal tender status
of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ignores other crypto asset classifications. Furthermore, other forms of crypto assets, like stablecoins, may
have unique characteristics that might complicate the HKMA’s study of
cryptocurrencies’ legal tender status. However, despite the fact that a
big number of individuals in Hong Kong recently employed stablecoins
to relocate their personal assets outside the government’s jurisdiction
after the enactment of Hong Kong’s national security legislation, there
is currently no special legislative framework for stablecoins.89
The SFC first released a statement on the regulatory framework for
virtual assets for portfolio managers, fund distributors, and trading platform operators, with the goal of limiting possible hazards. Given that a
virtual asset, under the SFC’s definition (‘…A virtual asset is a digital
representation of value, often known as ‘cryptocurrency,’ ‘crypto-asset,’
or ‘digital token…’), offers considerable risks to investors. The hazards
may arise as a consequence of the features of virtual assets and the operations of important stakeholders, such as virtual asset intermediation.90

As a result, authorities have mostly concentrated on regulating and
overseeing the connected activities of ICOs and crypto asset exchanges91
in terms of crypto asset regulation. In this respect, it’s worth noting that
the SFC’s approach is likewise rather comparable to those of other countries that prioritize meaningful intermediation. When it comes to crypto
asset regulation and supervision in Hong Kong, however, there are a few
different ways to examine.

Conclusion
Bitcoin, Ether (Ethereum), and XRP (Ripple) stand out amongst the
numerous crypto assets92 available owing to their persistently large market
capitalizations when compared to other crypto assets. A crypto token’s
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the number of tokens
in circulation by the current market price. Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP
accounted for over 70% of the total market capitalization in April 2021,
i.e., the entire market capitalization of all traded tokens.93
The issue of whether crypto and, in particular, 44 currency tokens
constitute money or even currencies in the traditional sense is at the
heart of the present economic debate. Despite the fact that the economic
significance and consequences of crypto assets are several times greater
and extend well beyond the currency element, this issue continues to
be a subject of scholarly discussion in this area.94 This is mostly due to
Bitcoin’s dominant position and its related goal of creating a payment and
currency system that is decentralized and free of intermediaries.95

Assigning a specific digital/crypto asset or token to a particular category is not always a straightforward process. For instance, certain assets
may be utilized in various ways depending on the context, and therefore may fall into two or more categories. Furthermore, assets may
change over time in response to changing user behaviour. As a result,
an asset’s categorization is not fixed, but rather requires a continuous and
dynamic evaluation of its characteristics, use, nature and related rights.
Accordingly, this may result in asset categories overlapping.
It is necessary to discuss further on legal and regulatory perspectives on crypto assets. In particular, they will consider such issues as the
“ownership” and “property” of crypto tokens, contractual ties in Initial
Coin Offering (ICO) and secondary market transactions, as well as intermediaries and distance contracts. There are other issues; for instance,
prospective responsibility under capital market laws, as well as other
aspects of capital market tort and liability law, along with mining and
mining pools need to be analysed. Additionally, as crypto token transactions are typically cross-border in nature, this results in the need to
determine the place of (international) jurisdiction (through the relevant law of jurisdiction as part of International Procedural Law (IPL)).
The main aim of the following chapter to catalogue the legal and
regulatory framework is associated with asset tokenization. This draws
relevant constraints and proposes an applicable framework, particularly for
ASEAN developing economies with fewer resources. Also, various factors
need to be considered, such as the socioeconomic and cultural aspects,
including local social and organizational structure, local resources, and the
structure of supervisory agencies, industry-standard organizations, and
collaborative mechanisms.

Fintech for Financial Inclusion
Felix Honecker and Dominic Chalmers

Introduction
A central claim of many financial technology firms is that they provide
new ways in which to address ‘the unbanked’, that is, groups that are
currently unable (or unwilling) to access traditional financial services.
The potential of digital technologies to address financial inclusion has
taken centre stage in numerous policy reports and development strategies
over recent years. This chapter delves into the intricacies of the debates
around fintech for financial inclusion and outlines some of the main issues
affecting practitioners and policymakers today.
First, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the causes and
consequences of financial exclusion. Second, we will outline the fintech
opportunity by illustrating how fintech introduces a new toolkit for
addressing these intractable problems and how it enables approaches
that had previously not been at our disposal. Third, we summarise three
success stories that illustrate how fintech for financial inclusion is making
an impact in markets as diverse as Kenya, China, and Scotland. Fourth,

we discuss opportunities for the public sector and elaborate how ‘fintech
for social good’ does not have to be market-driven. Finally, we discuss the
other side of the coin and illustrate how, despite the immense potential,
we must remain sensitive to potentially negative social impacts of financial
technology.

Financial Inclusion
Today, many societies are financialised to a degree that makes social life
difficult for people who struggle with (or are prevented from) accessing
or using financial services. Access to finance has become a central element
underpinning essential services around the globe. It facilitates day-to-day
living and money management, but also enables individuals and families
to plan for long-term goals or to make provisions against unexpected
drops in income—for example due to crop failures or job losses. It also
helps people escape from poverty and opens opportunities to invest into
their health, education, or businesses. Financial inclusion, thus, is not an
end, but a means to an end: it has been identified as a crucial enabler
for 7 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., No Poverty,
Good Health and Wellbeing, or Decent Work and Economic Growth).
Policymakers and development organisations around the globe are therefore striving for higher levels of financial inclusion. But what exactly does
financial inclusion mean?
According to the World Bank, being financially included means having
access to and being able to use affordable financial products and services
that are provided by sustainable, mainstream institutions (World Bank
Group 2018). Access to four types of products has been deemed essential:
transaction accounts, credit, savings, and insurance. For each of these four
types, which are widely perceived as the pillars of financial inclusion and
resilience, we can typically distinguish between unbanked and marginally
banked (or underserved) individuals. Because of their distinct characteristics, we now elaborate on the different degrees of financial exclusion for
each of the essential products.
Transaction Banking. For this product category, people with no bank
account at all would be considered unbanked. People with access to
a bank account without electronic payment facilities as well as individuals who have access to a transaction account but make little use or no
use of it are considered ‘marginally banked’ or underbanked. Account
ownership across the globe is growing quickly, but a significant number

8

FINTECH FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION

157

of people remains cut off from basic financial services. Globally, about
1.7 billion people remain unbanked—meaning they have no access to an
account at a mainstream financial institution at all (Demirguc-Kunt et al.
2018). A large majority of unbanked adults live in the developing world,
where account ownership sits at 63% on average but varies widely across
countries, even among those in close proximity. According to the Global
Findex Database 2017, there is still a considerable number of countries
in which less than 20% of the adult population owns a bank account
(Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018; World Bank Group 2017).
In developed societies, however, access to a bank account (and transaction banking facilities in particular) has become a universal need. In fact,
account ownership is perceived as the standard, and the lack of access
to or usage of such facilities is so uncommon that it carries a stigma.
Consequently, 94% of adults in high-income economies have an account
at a mainstream financial institution (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018). Most
official payments are made electronically, thus an account is a de facto
requirement for receiving regular funds such as wages, pensions, or social
welfare (Kempson et al. 2007). Crucially, other aspects of social life are
built on the fact that transaction accounts have become customary—it
is, for example, unlikely for someone without a bank account to find
quality employment or housing in a highly financialised society. Moreover, meeting basic financial obligations such as paying for utility bills
becomes considerably more difficult, more time consuming, and sometimes even more expensive if it cannot be done electronically (i.e., via
transaction account).
Owning and using a transaction account is often perceived as a
gateway to further financial services (e.g., credit, insurance, or sophisticated savings products). Promoting and enabling account ownership
has therefore become a priority for many governments, development
organisations, and other NGOs.
Credit. Access to credit plays a significant role in smoothing consumption, protection against income shocks, and enabling expenditures that
oversize the usual household budget. Even small credit can therefore
have substantial positive effects for individuals and families, for example
by facilitating social mobility or improving the quality of housing (and
therefore, indirectly, health and self-esteem) (Kempson et al. 2007). For
credit, too, we can identify various degrees of exclusion. This ranges from
no access to credit, to having access but being inappropriately served
(e.g., sub-prime or any type of money lender that charges particularly

158

F. HONECKER AND D. CHALMERS

high interest or offers unfavourable conditions). A good understanding
of the structure of national credit markets is particularly relevant to identify problems of credit exclusion. The existence of interest rate ceilings,
illegal lenders, credit unions, and other social or not-for-profit providers,
for example, can impact the situation drastically.
Because some types of credit (such as overdraft facilities or credit cards)
have very high adoption rates, particularly in developed economies, lack of
access to these instruments may stigmatise and negatively affect social life.
By contrast, borrowers in developing economies need to rely on informal
lenders such as family and friends much more often (Emran and Farazi
2009).
Savings. Findex data suggest that people are saving money in vastly
different ways. Many savers, particularly in high-income economies, save
formally through depositing money into an account at a mainstream
financial institution. More sophisticated options of formal savings include
investment products or government securities. Common alternatives to
savings are semiformal approaches (e.g., savings clubs) or entrusting
money to family members and friends for safekeeping (Demirguc-Kunt
et al. 2018). Informal saving methods include saving in the form of livestock or jewellery, or simply keeping cash at home (‘under the mattress’).
Just like credit, savings are a good way to build up emergency funds
and improve financial resilience. Moreover, savings are key to ensuring
financial independence and security in retirement.
The problems relating to savings exclusion are of a different nature
than those for transaction banking and credit. The availability of simple
deposit accounts seems not to be an intricate problem globally, and while
not having access to a savings account might cause various inconveniences, it does not necessarily relate to social exclusion (Kempson et al.
2007). Conversely, savings exclusion is often a consequence rather than
a cause of social problems: individuals might simply not have enough
money to save, might be unwilling to deal with banks due to a lack of
trust (often based on past experiences with lost or devalued savings) or
unable to develop a sustainable saving habit.
Insurance. Insurance can be fundamental to ensuring medium- and
long-term financial security and offers protection against unexpected fluctuations in income or expenditure. In many modern societies, several
insurances have become so important that they are now mandatory (e.g.,
traffic liability insurance, health insurance, etc.). However, there is no
clear definition of which types of insurance are essential so that the lack of

8

FINTECH FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION

159

a particular insurance does not necessarily indicate exclusion. The discussion on insurance is therefore somewhat different than those relating
to banking, credit, and savings. For this analysis, we understand insurance inclusion as the ability to access appropriate health, disability, and
home contents insurance products (e.g., affordable premiums, appropriate coverage, and suitable payment method).
Examining Financial Exclusion. To understand why many fintech
innovations are touted game-changers for enhancing financial inclusion,
it is necessary to first understand the intricacies of financial exclusion in
detail. Most importantly, we need to comprehend who remains excluded
and why.
Poorer people account for a disproportionate share of the unbanked
population worldwide, with half of the unbanked adults coming from
the poorest 40% of households (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018; World Bank
Group 2017). The pattern varies strongly across economies, however. In
those where the unbanked population is generally very high, unbanked
people are as likely to come from poorer households as they are from
wealthier ones, signalling distrust or other systemic problems with local
financial markets. In countries with an unbanked population of 25% or
lower, however, adults who are unbanked are much more likely to suffer
from financial poverty. They are also more likely to have been deprived
of educational opportunities: globally, only one third of unbanked adults
have completed high school or post-secondary education.
To shed light on why so many people are excluded from financial access, World Bank researchers conducted the Global Findex survey
(Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018). The most common reason for being financially excluded was having too little money to use an account, a response
that links to the observation of poorer households being excluded more
often. Two-thirds of study respondents cited this as at least one of
the reasons, with about 20% stating this was the sole reason for being
unbanked. About 25% declared cost and distance to providers as reasons
for exclusion, and a similar share mentioned that they do not have an
account because another member of the household already had one.
Other frequently mentioned reasons related to a lack of documentation,
distrust in the financial system, and religious concerns.
Up to this point, we have depicted financial inclusion and exclusion as two states—having and not having access to bank accounts,
access to appropriate credit, and so on. This description is also common

160

F. HONECKER AND D. CHALMERS

in academic research or policy analyses. More critically, such analyses typically suggest a unidirectional nature for the exclusion-inclusion
continuum, implying that there is a threshold that needs to be crossed
just once in order to ‘join the banked’ (e.g., by opening an account).
However, there are also conceptualisations of financial exclusion as a
more dynamic phenomenon. Elaine Kempson and Claire Whyley found
that it is not uncommon for households to close bank accounts if their
immediate circumstances change (Kempson and Whyley 1999). Similar
evidence was found for other financial products such as saving accounts
or home contents insurance. This indicates that people who are financially
included might revert to being excluded at a later point in time.
It also indicates that sometimes, there is a choice involved in accessing
and using even the four essential financial products. The use of protective services (e.g., insurance beyond the mandatory ones), for example,
largely depends on an individual’s perception of risk. Some people choose
to remain without insurance because they feel they will never need it or
because they are generally more venturesome than others. Similarly, there
is ample evidence signifying that many people are averse to borrowing
and make a conscious decision not to take use credit. Financial exclusion,
then, occurs for a variety of reasons ranging from companies outright
refusing to accept certain households as their customers all the way
to people who ‘self-exclude’ by making a conscious and unconstrained
choice not to access or use financial products. Oftentimes, however, the
barrier between direct and voluntary exclusion are blurred and people face
systemic barriers that encourage self-exclusion. The perceived extent of
individual choice is therefore another important element when analysing
financial exclusion.

The FinTech Opportunity
Globally, technological innovations are transforming how people engage
with money and finance. The fintech innovation movement has accelerated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, attracting record sums
in research and venture funding. A frequent prediction, endorsed by
academics, businesses, and policymakers alike, is that fintech will revolutionise financial inclusion as it offers a whole new tool kit for addressing
the intractable problems that are typically causing exclusion from finance.
We follow the Financial Stability Board in defining fintech as ‘technologyenabled innovation in financial services that could result in new business

8

FINTECH FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION

161

models, applications, processes, or products with an associated material
effect on the provision of financial services’.
The application of technology in finance is not new, but the current
wave of innovation proves to be a step change. New applications are
mobile-first, customer-centric, and disruptive to previously unchallenged
ways of the sector. These innovations are built on a financial technology
stack that is still evolving at a rapid pace. Artificial intelligence and
machine learning, cloud computing, open application programming interfaces, and blockchain are among the technologies expected to have the
greatest impact. But how exactly can fintech help to address the intricate
problems that we have highlighted in previous sections of this chapter?
To answer this question, we connect fintech technologies and business
models to the most common reasons for financial exclusion as identified
by the 2017 Findex survey and exemplify their potentially game-changing
effects.
Spatial Barriers. The concept of financial exclusion was first used to
describe geographical barriers to financial access, such as the distance
to (or complete lack of) bank branches or other essential infrastructure
within reach of a community. While the term’s meaning has evolved
significantly over the years, the problem from which it initially emanated
often remains—about a quarter of unbanked adults mentioned distance
to providers as a reason for being excluded (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018).
The increasing adoption of mobile and smartphones paired with
fintech innovations, however, open unprecedented opportunities to
address this issue. A simple mobile phone can potentially open access to a
mobile money account and eliminate the need to travel long distances to
a financial institution (if this was even possible). Popular mobile phonebased services allow users to deposit money into an account stored on
their phones, transfer money via text message (e.g., to pay for goods or
send money to friends), and access credit. Having access to a smartphone
and the internet expands the range of possibilities even further. This is
significant given that about two-thirds of the unbanked population globally have access to a mobile phone—and adoption of devices continues to
soar across the globe.
Cost. Historically, financial services firms have relied on a network
of brick-and-mortar branches that was expensive to operate. Recent
fintech innovations and the growing adoption of digital banking services,
however, are making more and more branches (and the costs associated with them) obsolete. Through fintech, similar inefficiencies can be

162

F. HONECKER AND D. CHALMERS

addressed along the finance value chain, for example where disconnected,
rigid technology systems are replaced by more agile cloud-based solutions, or when previously time-intensive, manual tasks that are typical for
finance businesses (e.g., searching, matching, comparing, filling forms,
reviewing, and other rules-based back-office activities) are automated
through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotic process
automation. These cost reductions potentially make financial products
and services more affordable to low-income consumers.
Other innovations, including many blockchain-based services, try to
disintermediate various aspects of financial services and promise further
cost reductions across payments, capital markets, trade services, and
wealth management. There is also the notion of using artificial intelligence
paired with complementary technologies (e.g., sensors or tracking apps)
to make predictions more accurate and further individualise pricing. For
many insurances, for example, businesses are trying to enable customers
to directly influence the price of their policies (e.g., by driving more carefully people could lower their traffic liability premiums, by eating healthier
or doing more sports they could lower their health insurance premiums
and so on).
Lack of Trust. While the exact figure varies widely across regions, an
average of about 16% of financially excluded adults cite a lack of trust
in financial providers as a reason for being unbanked (Demirguc-Kunt
et al. 2018). And the mistrust towards banks and other providers has only
been growing—fuelled by oblique fees, questionable behaviour, and fullblown scandals. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, for example,
distrust in financial institutions spread rapidly around the globe (Sapienza
and Zingales 2012).
Fintech innovators used this trust crisis to their advantage and quickly
legitimised new technologies, products, and business models. Many techdriven companies are aiming to increase transparency and encourage
competition by building digital marketplaces that allow for easier comparisons between providers. Others introduce solutions that make banks
(and therefore trust in them) redundant altogether, for example through
peer-to-peer lending platforms or blockchain-based digital wallets. Hence,
fintech offers a range of alternatives to individuals who have preciously
renounced financial access due to a lack of trust in traditional providers.
Lack of Documentation. Documentation requirements continue to
be a major barrier to account ownership in many economies. Several
fintech companies are working on digital identification services which can

8

FINTECH FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION

provide a critical enabler for alleviating this issue. Such services allow users
to digitally store a recognised form of identification on their phone. This
digital ID can be authenticated unambiguously through digital channels
(e.g., a central database that is accessible to select institutions). It can be
used to unlock access to finance, but also government services, education,
and other critical services (White et al. 2019). Other innovations, such
as cryptocurrencies, remove the need for documentation altogether and
allow everyone with access to the internet to participate in peer-to-peer
transactions without central institutions acting as intermediaries.
Financial Literacy and Capability. Knowledge and understanding of
financial products as well as financial skills and the confidence to apply
them are crucial elements of financial inclusion. They directly relate to
the perceived extent of choice that we discussed earlier in this chapter:
without appropriate levels of financial literacy and capability, individuals
are discouraged from accessing (potentially more appropriate) financial
services and oftentimes revert to self-exclusion.
Fintech offers new opportunities to make financial education more
engaging and effective. The sector has developed successful solutions
for digitally improving financial literacy through features such as video
lessons, flashcards, quizzes, simulations, and games. Many of these tools
are tailored towards children and young adults, trying to build capability
and good habits from a young age. Well-designed applications educate
their users about finance and help them make the right decision for
themselves.
Poverty. Financial poverty remains the most common and intractable
cause for financial exclusion. Almost two-thirds of World Bank survey
respondents stated having too little money as a reason for being excluded,
with 20% citing it as the sole reason for not accessing any form of financial services. Financial exclusion itself, however, is often a contributor to
poverty since exclusion often severely limits economic and educational
opportunities.
Poverty is an extremely complex, multifaceted concept, and discussing
its intricacies is beyond the scope of this chapter. And fintech will certainly
not eradicate poverty (particularly extreme poverty), but it shows the
potential to alleviate the issue for a significant share of unbanked or
underbanked individuals. Innovators have flooded the market with tools
that help with personal financial management and budgeting. Applications help consumers identify opportunities to reduce expenditure and
maximise their income, for example by identifying benefits eligibility or

164

by providing automated money guidance. Moreover, fintech can play an
important role in poverty prevention. By combining financial and nonfinancial data, for example, machine learning algorithms can potentially
uncover early warning signs of financial vulnerability that humans might
not be able to identify.

Success Stories: How Financial Inclusion
Can Be Profitable and Socially Productive
As illustrated, fintech creates a range of opportunities to drive social
change and increase financial inclusion. Crucially, it allows businesses
to address these societal problems in ways that go beyond philanthropy
or corporate social responsibility. Rather, their motivation is increasingly
business-driven as new technologies allow them to tap into these unserved
and underserved markets in economically viable ways. There are plenty
of success stories outlining how fintech firms successfully created both
economic and social value. In this section, we summarise some of them to
illustrate how financial inclusion can be a profitable business opportunity.
Kenya. M-PESA in Kenya provides a prime example of how mobile
technology can successfully deliver financial services to the unbanked. As
recently as 2006, more than 80% of the Kenyan population was working
with cash only and as few as 10% had bank accounts. A major reason
for this was that two-thirds of the population lived in rural areas, but an
overwhelming majority of bank branches and cash machines were in urban
centres. If city workers wanted to send money to their families living in
villages, they had to seal their wages in an envelope and send cash by post.
Mobile phone adoption, however, was very high, and telecommunications
providers had established a vast network of agents including retail outlets
and airtime resellers. The availability of this infrastructure had led Kenyans
to treat airtime as a substitute currency: minutes were easy to purchase,
store, transfer, and sell.
In 2007, as part of a financial deepening initiative, telecom operators Safaricom and Vodafone launched their money transfer service
M-PESA (Ndung’u 2018). Initially, the idea was to make it easier for
microfinance borrowers to receive and repay loans while simultaneously
allowing lenders to offer more competitive rates. During the piloting
phase, however, Safaricom and Vodafone noticed the use of airtime as
a medium of exchange. Additionally, they realised that customers were
frequently repurposing the product to send remittances to friends and

8

FINTECH FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION

165

families. They changed M-PESA’s value proposition and turned it into
a huge success. M-PESA now allows its users to deposit and withdraw
money at local telecom retailers, transfer money to other users, pay bills,
purchase minutes, and deposit money into a virtual savings account. By
2016, about 96% of households in Kenya were using M-PESA, and the
service had lifted 194,000 households out of poverty (Suri and Jack
2016).
China. China has become one of the world’s premier financial technology markets, leading the race in product innovation, market size,
and consumer adoption (Patwardhan 2018). While the Chinese fintech
sector began with thousands of companies introducing innovative products to the market, it has recently consolidated around China’s internet
giants. Alibaba, Tencent, and JD have leveraged their nationwide ecommerce infrastructure to provide a variety of financial services to their
vast customer bases. Interestingly, these firms have focused on extending
financial access (and access to credit in particular) to the historically
excluded countryside, where the adoption of smartphones and internet
access have recently skyrocketed. The tech-companies created financial
products that seamlessly integrated with their existing solutions, a move
that boosted adoption. Moreover, they can draw on the massive amounts
of data collected through their existing online businesses to assess credit
risk. This is a step change for rural areas, where traditional institutions
often struggled to assess risk and provide loans due to a dearth of financial
information (Kong and Loubere 2021).
The results of China’s digital finance revolution are astonishing. In
2016, the total value of mobile payments exceeded $790 billion—11
times more than that of the United States (Woetzel et al. 2017). Crucially,
the number of non-bank digital payments in rural China grew by a staggering 93% from 2017 to 2018, indicating rapid adoption and use of
fintech tools among previously excluded consumers.
Scotland. Issues of financial exclusion and vulnerability are of course
not limited to developing economies. In the United Kingdom, for
example, there are still approximately 1.2 million individuals without
access to the most basic financial services. Additionally, over 11 million
adults from a wide range of demographics (e.g., young people, over 80year olds, people with disabilities, people with mental health issues, people
of faith, and migrants and refugees) are underserved. A large share of
excluded and underserved individuals are people on low income.

166

F. HONECKER AND D. CHALMERS

The Scottish fintech firm InBest.ai has recognised that many people
could be better off but miss out on some or all the benefits they are
eligible for. Their research found that this problem existed for as many as
8 million households across the United Kingdom, with about £16 billion
in benefits being overlooked. The reasons for not taking up benefits were
divers: almost half of InBest’s customers had simply assumed they weren’t
entitled, another 39% were unaware of their benefits, and about a fifth
struggled with the complexity of the application process. The firm developed a benefits calculation platform that would help vulnerable consumers
to understand, apply for, and monitor their benefits. The platform is
integrated into the workflows of partner companies (e.g., financial institutions, debt advice providers, etc.) with services customers were already
using. This contributed to a seamless customer journey and data sharing
with other stakeholders in the support ecosystem.
The company found that 70% of its customers could claim an additional £500 per month. For 5% of their customers, they identified
a staggering £1,500 of unclaimed monthly benefits. InBest quickly
became a success and a valuable tool to the Scottish support network.
By helping financially vulnerable households to maximise their income,
InBest increases their financial resilience, avoids over-indebtedness, and
potentially prevents financial poverty.

Public Sector-Led Approaches
to FinTech for Financial Inclusion
In the previous section, we have described how fintech businesses can
address societal problems through a commercial logic. Such approaches
are usually positioned under the umbrella of social innovation, a concept
that appears in various academic disciplines, including sociology (Zapf
1991), creativity (Mumford 2002), entrepreneurship (Swedberg 2009;
Ziegler 2010), and welfare economics (Jenson 2015). While conceptualisations within and across these fields vary, they generally share the idea
that social innovation includes a form of reconfiguration that causes a
macro-level social change. Crucially, it is not considered the prerogative or privilege of businesses but can also be introduced by NGOs or
governments.
Many administrations are increasingly embedding fintech in government services, for example to distribute subsidies, unemployment benefits, or welfare payments. Most governments are also experimenting

8

FINTECH FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION

167

with standalone public sector financial technologies. Some of the most
promising government-driven fintech innovations are central bank digital
currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs are an exclusively digital form of central
bank issued money made accessible to the broad public (Bindseil 2020).
While there are several technological approaches to CBDCs, the most
prominent one was inspired by Bitcoin and similar blockchain-based
cryptocurrencies. However, CBDCs would differ from those ‘private’
digital currencies in that they would operate on a distributed but centrally
controlled database (managed and maintained by the respective central
bank or government) rather than on a decentralised system.
The advantages expected from CBDCs range from improved technological efficiency (Bindseil 2020) through easier tax collection processes
and all the way to having new channels for monetary policy (Heller 2017).
CBDCs could also enable governments to make huge strides towards
financial inclusion. Governments could, for example, offer safe money
accounts at the central bank for free (or at very low cost) to every citizen
or legal resident. This could constitute a strong instrument for financial inclusion, connecting all legal residents to a secure, digital payments
system without facing many of the traditional exclusionary issues. Unsurprisingly, about 80% of all central banks are currently exploring central
bank digital currencies, with some of them having progressed into pilot
phases (Galbraith and Shen 2022).

FinTech for Financial
Inclusion---A Double-Edged Sword?
So far, we have illustrated that fintech innovations have led to significant progress around financial inclusion and that there is much more to
be excited about. However, the potentialities we have outlined in this
chapter only show one side of the fintech coin and are accompanied by
a range of socio-political risks that require thorough consideration going
forward. We are worried that current narratives of ‘fintech for social good’
legitimise a form of techno-solutionism, that is, the flawed idea that any
social problem, no matter how complex, has a technological fix (Morozov
2013). Financial technology should not be framed as a panacea to the
intractable, multifaceted issues that excluded individuals often face. We
suggest analysing the downsides of fintech from three angles: first, we
employ a sociocultural lens and contend that the increasing digitisation
of essential services creates a significant risk of exacerbating existing and

168

F. HONECKER AND D. CHALMERS

creating new forms of financial and social exclusion. Second, we shed light
on the power structures that are embedded in and further enabled by the
technologies underlying many fintech innovations. Finally, we question
the motivations and ideologies behind some of the initiatives that drive
fintech adoption among previously unserved consumers.
Sociocultural Factors and Contradictory Effects. In a previous
section, we have matched fintech potentialities to common causes of
financial exclusion (spatial barriers, cost, lack of trust, lack of documentation, financial literacy and capability, and poverty). There are,
however, potentially adverse effects involved in applying fintech to these
problems as well. The increasing digitisation of financial services, for
example, can help to overcome existing spatial barriers, but also create
new ones. Digital finance has led to the closure of a significant number of
bank branches, potentially excluding technology-averse individuals. The
withdrawal of mainstream financial institutions is most pronounced in
rural (and often deprived) areas, where underappreciated hurdles relating
to broadband availability, network signals, and data poverty1 amplify
its exclusionary effects. At worst, this aggravates existing inequalities,
expands the digital divide, and further isolates vulnerable groups.
Earlier we have pointed towards the opportunity of fintech to improve
financial literacy and capability through methods like gamification. This
potential should not obscure the fact that most fintech applications
themselves require high levels of financial and digital capability, thereby
reinforcing exclusion. In some of our own research, we found vulnerable consumers often feel excluded from existing fintech services as they
struggle to make sense of new product and service offerings. Further,
attempts to ‘educate’ marginalised consumers are often patronising and
the complexity of technological jargon in combination with overused
buzzwords act disengaging.
The new, data-hungry applications might also create new drivers of
financial exclusion. If algorithms make credit or insurance decisions, for
example, then accessing these products requires an extensive data history.
People who suffer from data poverty or deliberately avoid leaving a data
trail, then, might be disadvantaged and denied access to these essential
services. Individuals might have no choice but to establish a data history

1 Data poverty occurs where disadvantaged groups cannot afford to purchase enough
data to access online services.

8

169

(at the expense privacy) if they want to evade unfair price discrimination
or exclusion.
Technological Politics. A holistic understanding of fintech risks
requires a closer look at the technologies that are at the core of the
global fintech movement, and the politics they potentially enable. Central
bank digital currencies, for example, might enable governments to equip
their citizens with cheap access to transaction accounts but also represent a potentially troubling encroachment on consumer privacy. Such
government-issued accounts would provide new tools for surveillance
and new means to assert control. Imagine, for example, that the fine
for a parking violation would be taken out of your account automatically. What would stop governments from weaponising this power by
freezing accounts or blocking lawful transactions of government critics or
other people who have fallen into disfavour? If implemented without welldesigned privacy protection mechanisms, CBDCs might lead to (self-)
censorship and regressive social developments.
Other concerns can be found in the field of artificial intelligence.
AI has been subject to increased criticism highlighting the issue of
biased algorithmic decision-making and how it might lead to unjust
or prejudicial treatment of marginalised groups based on race, gender,
disability, religion, income, or other characteristics historically associated with discrimination (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018; Tsamados et al.
2021; Zou and Schiebinger 2018). By delegating decisions about who
receives credit, who is eligible for benefits, or who pays what for insurance to an algorithm, we are running the risk of automating inequality
and restricting peoples’ access to public resources rather than providing
greater support (Crawford 2021). The citizens of Michigan experienced
this problem at first hand when former Republican governor Rick Snyder
introduced algorithmically driven austerity programmes. Between 2012
and 2015, one of the programmes misidentified nineteen thousand citizens as ‘fugitive felons’ and automatically disqualified them from food
assistance. The other one inaccurately identified forty thousand Michigan
residents as defrauding the state’s unemployment insurance system, many
of whom had to declare bankruptcy due to hefty civil penalties, the
seizure of tax refunds, and the confiscation of wages (Richardson et al.
2019). Crawford (2021) details how AI-systems are designed to serve and
reinforce existing systems of power, and how they fuel a shift to undemocratic governance whose potential implications we must consider when
evaluating fintech for financial inclusion.

170

Ideological Factors and Finance-led Capitalism. There is increasing
suspicion towards both the intentions and methods of organisations
that are addressing social ills through business logics. This suspicion
is certainly justified. The recent history of international development
initiatives is littered with hyped-up innovations that were touted gamechangers in the fight against poverty (e.g., microcredit). Many of these
innovations, unfortunately, were shown to be ‘quite ineffective and only
really promoted for ideological, political, or narrow profiteering reasons’
(Bateman et al. 2019, p. 482).
A closer look at the success story of M-PESA, for example, reveals a
near-monopolistic provider who is sometimes condemned for imposing
high prices on its financially vulnerable users (Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation 2013). Critics go as far as to accuse M-PESA of employing
extractive practices that generate large profits through taxing payments
that would have been free if cash was used (Bateman et al. 2019). There
is an argument to be made that, much more than its marginalised user
base, it was Safaricom that has benefitted from M-PESA. (Wyche et al.
2016).
Understanding poverty as a new frontier for profit-making and accumulation carries the risk of equating financial inclusion and financialisation
(Bayliss et al. 2017), and the growing push for applying information technologies to problems of exclusion potentially confines policy-making to
an increasingly powerful digital elite that experiences little contestation
from global development players. The digitalised approach to financial
inclusion encourages practices that delineate marginalised and excluded
individuals into categories of ‘borrowers’ and sometimes gives the impression that incorporating these consumers into global strategies of capital
accumulation, not lifting them from poverty, is the overarching goal of
these initiatives (Gabor and Brooks 2017).

Conclusion
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the opportunities that
financial technology introduces to the global financial inclusion agenda.
We have illustrated that recent fintech innovations have the potential
to be a step change as they offer new tools to directly tackle common
causes of financial exclusion, including spatial barriers, high costs, a lack of
trust in traditional financial providers, a lack of documentation, financial

literacy and capability, and poverty. Nevertheless, we need to acknowledge that fintech also poses risks to financial and social exclusion of which
we need to remain cognisant. Only then can we ensure fintech is socially
productive and alleviates these intractable issues rather than exacerbating
them.
