ABSTRACT With the development of blockchain technology, the research on digital currency is attracting
more and more attention, especially Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which plays an important role
in national economic construction. However, compared with existing cryptocurrencies, CBDC needs a more
controllable decentralization and more emphasized supervision. Therefore, the critical part of CBDC is the
network architecture that saves computing resources, the technical scheme that is in line with economic
ecology, and efficient consensus algorithms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid blockchain system with a
modularity network for CBDC. The account scheme is used to record frequently circulated digital currencies,
especially for massive small payment transactions when the digital assets and smart contracts with large
value fluctuations and weak liquidity are recorded using the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) scheme.
In terms of network architecture, a modular blockchain architecture is proposed, and a sliced data storage
solution is designed to enhance the concurrency of this structured network. We also proposed a CBDC
supervision mode for blockchain, and on this basis, the DPOS-BFT algorithm is optimized, which reduces
the two rounds of consensus of the original algorithm to one round. Finally, three simulation experiments on
scheme, network, and consensus are carried out, which show this system can comprehensively improve the
transaction processing and the consensus speed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Virtual currency refers to a formless currency, which is an
alternative payment method rather than legally mandatory
[1]. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a virtual currency based on node network and digital encryption algorithm
issue by a country with which has a Legal Credit Protection
[2], [3]. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the encrypted
digital currency ‘‘Bitcoin’’ [4], which is the first fully distributed digital currency [5]. After that, digital currencies
such as Bitshares [6], Bitcoin Cash [7], and Dash [8] appeared
one after another. Compared with traditional cash currency,
digital currency is more convenient to use, lower in cost, and
richer in functions [9]. Thus, in the current era of electronic
payment, the development of digital currency is the general
trend [10]. However, private digital currencies cannot be

directly applied at the national level, either in the design
concept or performance scheme [11]. Currently, more and
more countries have begun to research the CBDC because
of the advantages such as payment optimizing, supervision
strengthening, and economic output improving. Supported
by blockchain technology, CBDC is expected to become the
main currency and infrastructure in the new economic era,
and play an important role in the financial fields of auditing,
banking and insurance [12].
In 2014, China started research on fiat digital currencies
and achieved staged results in key parts such as theory and
framework. The Bank of England proposed the world’s first
central bank digital currency in 2015, RSCoin [13]. The prototype is based on the UTXO but does not take into account
the legal digital issuance and circulation. In 2016, X. Zhou
proposed the technical route and design principles of legal
digital currency and pointed out that digital currency needs
to be convenient and secure to strengthen the operation and

transmission of monetary policy. Canada launched the Jasper
project to study the Canadian dollar fiat digital currency in
2017 [14]. In the same year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, European Central Bank, and Bank of Japan also carried
out research on CBDC with the project named Ubin [15]
and STELLA [16]. Tsai et al. proposed an account-based fiat
digital currency in 2018 [17]. They point out that the account
scheme has sufficient advantages over the UTXO scheme in
performance, and has performed a detailed analysis of the
technical implementation. And the People’s Bank of China
published a prototype system of digital currency and related
experimental reports [18]. Ubin and Jasper’s project team
cooperated with the Bank of England to develop an official
digital currency cross-border settlement system in 2019 [19].
And Facebook announced the issuance of Libra, a global
sovereign digital currency [20].
To sum up, all countries are scrambling to study CBDC at
present, but most of the research is limited to a certain part
of the problem. However, a complete theoretical system and
innovative technical model are needed for the research and
implementation of CBDC. Our solution is a comprehensive
and in-depth design of the operating mechanism (issuance
and circulation), network architecture, and consensus algorithms. We proposed a network architecture that divides the
blockchain nodes into ordering nodes, verification nodes,
and central nodes in [21]. Although consensus mechanism
was improved base on PBFT, it has not been verified by
experiments.
The following contributions are made in this paper: We
propose a CDBC scheme with a hybrid technology route.
In this solution, an account scheme is used to record frequently circulated digital currencies, especially for the settlement, verification, and inquiry of massive small payment
transactions, which can greatly improve the processing speed.
It uses the form of UTXO to record digital assets with large
value fluctuations and weak liquidity to improve the availability of digital currencies. CBDC’s need for efficient payments is met through improvements to the modular alliance
chain architecture. The rate of consensus is greatly improved
through the improvement of the DPOS-BFT algorithm.
II. PROBLEM ANALYSIS

To study the problems existing in the current CBDC system,
we made analyses from three aspects: digital currency expression, network architecture, and consensus mechanism.
A. ANALOGY OF CURRENT DIGITAL CURRENCY
EXPRESSION SCHEMES

There are two major digital currency expression schemes:
UTXO and Account. UTXO is an encrypted string with face
value which seems as cash, and the scheme is used in Bitcoin
[22]. The transfer mechanism of UTXO is shown in Fig. 1.
One or more UTXOs be consumed by a transaction as an
input, and several new UTXOs which can be used in a future
transaction will be created. UTXO allows multiple transactions in parallel because there is no account. It also has a
53590

high degree of privacy and is suitable for currency systems
with high-security requirements [23]. Except for Coinbase
transactions, the input of a transaction is always linked behind
a UTXO. Transactions cannot be replayed, and the order and
dependencies of transactions are easy to verify, and whether
transactions are consumed is also easy to prove.
The account scheme uses a list to save the balance of
users like bank accounts. A transaction is valid if the sending
account has enough balance to pay for it, in which case
the sending account is debited and the receiving account is
credited with the value. The scheme is used in Ethereum,
the account of which not only saves the balance but also saves
the code of smart contract and some internal states when the
UTXO scheme saves them in the encrypted string. Account
schemes have advantages in transaction processing speed
without complicated operation mechanism. And its smart
contract have more functions but more complexity or greater
resource consumption.
1) THE UTXO SCHEME

We find some problems when applying the UTXO scheme
to CDBC, such as high spatial complexity caused by massive
small payments. UTXO digital currency relies on transaction
records [24]. The input and output of each transaction are
UTXO, so the metadata stored in the database is the transaction record. From the metadata, we can derive each UTXO.
If the owner provides the correct public key, we can verify
the legitimacy of the UTXO. But the calculation of UTXO
derived from metadata is quite complicated, especially for a
fiat digital currency system with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of users, there can be billions of transactions
in one month. According to data from the China National
Network Clearing Corporation, the number of online fund
payment transactions from January 24 to 30 during the Spring
Festival holiday in 2020 will reach 4.919 billion.
Just searching out so much transaction data as input and
output for UTXO imposes a great burden on its server performance, let alone checking the legality within the irreversible
cycle of the blockchain. Thus, the UTXO solution cannot
deal with such billions of large-scale small-payment simple
transactions.
2) THE ACCOUNT SCHEME

More complex contract code requires more storage and runs
more resources, and thus it is more likely to cause errors
on the system and the network. Running a large number of
DApps increases the maintenance cost of blockchain, and it
VOLUME 9, 2021

J. Zhang et al.: Hybrid Model for Central Bank Digital Currency Based on Blockchain

can be easily crowd out the most basic payment functions of
digital currencies. Overall, UTXO also has this shortcoming,
due to different operating mechanisms. Its severity is much
less than that of the account scheme. Thus, we need a balanced solution which limits the complexity of smart contract
when using the account scheme.
In terms of construction and maintenance, the costs of
account scheme are higher than the UTXO costs. When
it comes to the functionality and scalability, the UTXO is
appropriate for building digital assets, and the account is
suitable for building DApps. Considering transaction efficiency, the account scheme is better than UTXO, while some
flexibility of smart contract are sacrificed.
B. CURRENT BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK NODE
ARCHITECTURE

The blockchain network architecture is divided into traditional peer-to-peer networks and structured modular networks [25]. The former is used in most digital currencies such
as Bitcoin, when the latter is used as alliance chains.
1) TRADITIONAL BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE

Traditional digital currency systems tend to use a unified
wallet software as a node carrier, which updated by a community or cooperative organization and keeping all nodes
in a fair state. Hence, a node usually keeps a complete
ledger database and receives digital currency rewards from
local mining. Besides, the node also stores the user’s private
key, initiates a transaction, acts as a proxy for others, and
provides basic functions (consensus, encryption, decryption,
hash operations, transaction pools, etc.). Therefore, all nodes
in the architecture are comprehensive but difficult to make
custom optimization.
Users and enterprises interact by transactions, especially
from the Dapp contract. In a peer-to-peer network, the transaction sent to the blockchain using a broadcasting way. Due
to this, multiple nodes may independently process the same
transaction request at the same time. But according to consensus rules, only one node can obtain the accounting opportunity in a period. Therefore, the processing of this transaction
by nodes without accounting is meaningless.
In general, it can be known that the traditional digital
currency system architecture has the following problems:
a) Waste of node resources. For the beginning, the participants mortgage their computer resources to obtain profits.
These profits were invested to improve the system performance. But the relationship between the nodes is competitive,
the nodes cannot cooperate and independently handle the
repeated transaction. All the resources cannot be fully utilized
either.
b) The lack of modularity. All the functions of digital
currencies are integrated and carried out by official publishers. The participants need to use a fully developed official
node program. It is difficult to allocate or modularize node
functions according to the advantages of computer resources
in their possession, which makes it impossible to apply
VOLUME 9, 2021

distributed solutions like microservices. Therefore, performance, compatibility, and security may become hidden issues
in the future.
c) The competition of transaction processing fees is contrary to the design concept of CDBC. In a system with limited
performance, users need to pay more fees to ensure their
transactions be prioritized. This is inconsistent with the social
fairness required by CDBC.
2) MODULAR BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE

As the alliance chain itself is used in a semi-centralized
scenario, the nodes have more credibility between peers. The
architecture design of alliance chain is more flexible, such
as the Hyperledger Fabric [26]. Especially, this architecture
modularizes the functions of nodes and sets different permissions for them. When a fault occurs, the faulty part can be
repaired separately in this way. If there is a demand, a type of
node can be expanded alone to enhance the processing capacity. In the design, the repeated processing work is reduced,
more resources are saved, thus the performance of the system
is improved.
There are still several problems in this architecture. Firstly,
the current using alliance chain network is mostly designed
to share data between business organizations across industries. In order to improve business richness, all functions
in the chain are based on smart contracts, including simple
transactions. Although we can implement all the demands
of CBDC by smart contracts, the system’s performance and
scalability are inferior to those of directly processing on the
basic function. Secondly, the solution for permissions in the
alliance chain is using a method similar to build several subchains. It uses nodes with different permissions to maintain
different blockchains with the same architecture [27]. The
design does not fit the CDBC that needs to be unified.
Compared with the centralized system, the traditional digital currency architecture has the drawbacks of operating efficiency and resource consumption. The modular architecture
has excellent performance, but its original design concepts do
not fit the CDBC reformed.
C. CONSENSUS MECHANISM IN THE CURRENT
BLOCKCHAIN

The consensus mechanism is the core of the blockchain system telling how the nodes synchronize the ledger. Most of
the components of the blockchain architecture are designed
around the consensus mechanism to ensure that the system
can still operate normally under any extreme conditions.
Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work
(POW), Proof of Stake (POS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), Ripple Consensus Protocol (RCP), Delegated
Proof of Stake (DPOS), and so on.
1) THE POW CONSENSUS MECHANISM

The POW mechanism is designed for the Bitcoin system. The
computing power competition of distributed nodes is used to
ensure the consistency of data and the security of consensus.
53591

J. Zhang et al.: Hybrid Model for Central Bank Digital Currency Based on Blockchain

The nodes on the POW network compete for ledger writing
via complex and meaningless calculations. The network can
keep stable, except for some nodes own half of calculation
ability. To solve the problem of block forks, the period of
producing each block cannot be too short. But this can cause
a decrease in transaction processing speed.
2) THE POS CONSENSUS MECHANISM

In POS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block
is chosen via various combinations of random selection and
wealth or age (i.e., the stake). The ledger writing authority is
easier obtained by the node with the higher stake. The bookkeeping nodes do not need to run complex calculations, which
effectively avoids resource consumption. But the nodes can
get the bookkeeping authority are always those who have the
most mortgage stake. Accordingly, there is a potential risk
that the network is controlled by the richest node. Similar to
POW, to solve the hard block fork, the transaction processing
efficiency of the blockchain system is still relatively low.
3) THE PBFT CONSENSUS MECHANISM

PBFT is a relatively balanced solution, which can be stable
when the number of all nodes is at least 3f+1 (f is the number
of nodes that do not respond to failures/faults). However, theoretically, the nodes need to perform 2n2 + n (n is the number
of nodes) times of communication to consensus, which is not
efficient enough when n is very large. But this mechanism is
still faster than POW and more secure than POS.
4) THE DPOS CONSENSUS MECHANISM

DPOS consensus algorithm is improved based on the POS
algorithm, which used in Bitshares, Steem, and EOS. The
scope of block producer ’s nodes is greatly reduced, and
these master nodes mortgaged their currency or computer
resource to get the vote from the entire network. A small-scale
POS or PBFT consensus is used between these master nodes
to synchronize and broadcast blocks. Due to the number of
producer nodes generally is less than 50, the broadcast numbers and resource requirement is reduced, and the processing
speed is improved. However, there are some considerations:
Firstly, for the normal users, the enthusiasm for voting is
not high, the risks of Sybil Attack should be considered.
Secondly, the DPOS used in EOS point that the block fork is
easy to appear in a high latency network, which requires more
additional measures to solve. Therefore, in extreme cases, the
performance of DPOS may be worse.
In the POW and POS consensus mechanism, most of the
participants only verify the produced block, but cannot refute
the block content when the malicious nodes have controlled
half of the resource or vote. The PBFT mechanism is stable
and efficient, but the performance can severely decrease when
the number of nodes continues to increase. DPOS is a balanced mechanism to solve the Sybil Attack when used in a
relatively centralized environment such as CDBC. Besides,
we also consider to use the DPOS-BFT algorithm that combining the PBFT to further improve the processing speed.

III. THE SCHEME OF CBDC
A. OVERALL DESIGN

UTXO and account are two basic digital currency scheme
models. Some defects were found when these models are
directly applied to CBDC as analysis in the previous chapter.
In this section, a hybrid digital currency scheme is proposed
to mix the advantages of the two schemes.
The hybrid digital currency scheme is shown in Fig. 2. The
bottom layer of the solution uses a distributed blockchain network formed by various commercial and government departments under the leadership of the central bank. The account
scheme is used for the calculation and representation of digital currency to accelerate the basic transactions. In order to
meet the additional function requirement such as financial
assets and Dapps, we implement them with UTXO scheme.
This can make up the limitations in the smart contract of the
account scheme without hindering the processing of basic
transactions.
According to the ‘‘Analysis Report of China’s Fund Industry in 2020’’, ‘‘Overall Situation of the Payment System
Operation in the Second Quarter of 2019’’ [28] and ‘‘Statistical Report on the Development of China’s Internet Network
in 2019’’, it is estimated that 87% of online transactions are
small payments Class operation, no need to extend special
functions. Therefore, the basic payment transactions should
be ensured to run in the highest priority without any barriers.
In our design, the digital currency for payment with frequent circulation and stable value are recorded in the account
scheme. While the financial assets are recorded in the UTXO
scheme with a complex contract, large value fluctuations, and
weak circulation. By this mean, the advantage of payment
processing speed in the account scheme can be given full
play, because the most resource-consuming operations such
as contract and assets are independently processed in the
UTXO scheme.
B. DESIGN OF KEY MODULES
1) ACCOUNT

In the account scheme, the amount of digital currency owned
by the user is represented by his account balance. The account
is completely visible to its holder, and also transparent to
VOLUME 9, 2021

J. Zhang et al.: Hybrid Model for Central Bank Digital Currency Based on Blockchain

TABLE 1. The structure of account, asset, and transaction.

FIGURE 3. The schematic diagram of the transfer mechanism.

the central bank. Other nodes and third parties cannot obtain
the user’s private information. Users need to submit relevant
personal or financial department information for account
approval. Meanwhile, a user can only hold a limited number
of accounts according to the law of the central bank.
The design of he account structure in Java class expression is shown in Table 1. Among them, id is the unique
identification of the account. Timestamp is the last modified
time. Operates cites all the related transactions of this block
to improve the trace speed. Address is the identity of the
owner. PublicKey is the public key of the account. Value is the
balance of the account. Contracts storage all the lightweight
executable functions of account smart contract, which standardized by the central bank and can be quickly executed with
light resource consumption unlike the digital assets or UTXO
contract developed by the third parties.

the transactions. Besides, each transaction must carry the
signature of the owner of account or assets to prove the
validity.
The design of the transaction structure in Java class expression is shown in Table 1. Id is the unique identification of
a digital asset. Timestamp is the processing success time.
Sender and receiver are the initiators and target account of
the transaction. Value is the amount of digital currency or the
number of assets for transfer. Input and output cite the id
of UTXO supported. It needs to be noted that input should
be provided by the sender before processing when the output is created by the operator. Signatures storage all necessary digital signature from the sender. Contracts storage the
lightweight smart contracts or scripts the same as the account
scheme, which provides some convenient operations but not
consume lots.

2) DIGITAL ASSETS (UTXO)

The digital asset is an electronic voucher with the UTXO
scheme for a right that requires others to pay digital currency in our design. It can be used as bank savings, securities or funds, etc. The transferability and tradability were
endorsed by the central bank. In the UTXO solution, a digital
asset is a set of strings that encrypt the basic elements of
the asset. The basic elements are the key information such
as the ownership, face value, and smart contract constraints
of the digital asset.
The design of the asset structure in Java class expression is
shown in Table 1. Id is the unique identification of a digital
asset. Timestamp is the creation time. Operate cites the origin
transaction which outputs this UTXO. Type expresses the
nature of this digital asset. Owner cites the account right to
use this UTXO. Issuer storages a verifiable publisher ’s Information. Value is the amount of this digital asset. Contracts
storage all the unlock scripts or smart contracts of the digital
asset which is implemented by the issuers and may have
complex functions or limits and consume lots of resources.
3) TRANSACTION

Transactions are the basis for the changes of user accounts
and digital assets. There are different types of transactions
not only to transfer digital currencies or assets but also to
run smart contracts. For the input of UTXO or the digital
currency amount, receiver and sender should be written in
VOLUME 9, 2021

C. DESIGN OF THE OPERATING MECHANISM
1) TRANSFER MECHANISM

The transfer mechanisms for digital currency or digital asset
are different owing to mixing the account and UTXO in
our design. The mixed transfer mechanism in the typical
scenarios is shown as Fig. 3.
For the digital currency payment scenario where user 2
pays a digital currency to user 1, the process is as follows:
First, user 2 needs to specify the consumption amount, and
transfer account by digital currency wallet software or other
enters. After that, the wallet automatically generates a transaction according to the instructions and sends it to the CBDC
network that finally transfers it to the corresponding node
for operation. The node can recognize the payment requirements and verifies its legitimacy. At this time, if there are
no active smart contracts under the accounts of both parties,
the payment process is started directly: the account of user 2
is deducted, and the account balance of user 1 is increased.
The transaction and account change can be written in block.
After the next blockchain cycle begins, transactions become
irreversible. Finally, user 1 makes a query or accepts the
push information from the wallet to confirm the successful
payment.
For the digital asset trading scenario where user 1 wants
to buy a fund from a financial company, the process is as
follows:
53593

J. Zhang et al.: Hybrid Model for Central Bank Digital Currency Based on Blockchain

FIGURE 4. The schematic diagram of the issuance mechanism.

First, the fund needs to be issued as UTXO by the company. After user 1 negotiating purchase with the companies
through websites or dealers, a transaction to pay for digital
currencies and transfer UTXO is created. Both user 1 and
company sign the contract with their private key, and the
generated signatures are attached to the transaction, which
are used as the validity verifying parameters. After the two
parties confirmed that, the transaction is sent to the CNDC
network. After these signatures checked by the third-level
nodes, the account of user 1 is debited, and the company’s
account balance increases. Then the input fund UTXO from
the company is cancelled, while the fund UTXO owned by
user 1 is generated. If there is an overflow in the input fund
UTXO, an additional fund UTXO owned by the company is
generated as a change, and the amount is the overflowed part.
2) ISSUANCE, CIRCULATION, AND WITHDRAWAL

The issuance of CBDC is similar to the UTXO transfer.
As shown in Fig. 4, here is an example that a commercial
bank withdraws the reserve from central bank: First, the commercial bank applies, then a special transaction is generated
after approval. The transaction does not specify the sender but
carries the signature of the central bank. If the commercial
bank held a CBDC reserve of digital assets, it can use them
as input for transactions. Otherwise, it converts cash reserve
into CBDC reserve. After that, the transaction sends the
corresponding amount of digital currency to the account of
the commercial bank, whose reserve is deducted on a reserve
manager non-CBDC system in the central bank. In the next
blockchain cycle, these transactions are synchronized to the
entire network, thereby completing the issuance of digital
currencies.
As shown in Fig. 4, The circulation of CBDC is mainly
through users’ savings and withdrawals. In fact, the deposits
can also be regarded as a UTXO asset used for the input
of transactions. When saving money, commercial banks also
provide users with UTXO deposit through the output of transactions as the proof of saving.
Fig. 5 shows the design of the CBDC withdraws. First, the
central bank issues a certain amount of UTXO bills or checks,
and commercial banks apply the purchasing authority of
them. At the time of purchasing, the UTXO bill is used as
the input of the transaction, and the smart contract of the
53594

FIGURE 5. The schematic diagram of the withdraw mechanism.

FIGURE 6. The ‘‘single-core’’ supervision mode.

bill deducts the account of the commercial bank. Finally,
the commercial bank owns the output UTXO bill to complete
the withdrawal of digital currency.
3) SUPERVISION MODE AND SECURITY

We adopt the ‘‘single-core’’ supervision mode supplemented
by the alliance chain [29]. The supervisory mechanism is
shown in Fig.6. The central bank supervises the data of
the blockchain network and punishes or appoints nodes. All
nodes should hold digital certificates issued by the central
bank. Whether the third-party companies and financial institutions want to issue digital assets, or participate in CBDC
accounting, they must apply to the central bank for digital certificates. In addition, the central bank has the right to freeze
the illegal accounts, roll back transactions, and confiscate
assets or CBDC.
Besides, the data of peer nodes are transparent to each
other has the same privilege, and the final approved data
is expressed on the blockchain network for preventing the
central bank’s misuse operation. The mandatory operation
executed by the central bank firstly should be broadcasted to
the most privileged node which storage the blockchain data.
Nodes verify and assess the operation, and can make a refusal
when the central bank is being controlled or attacked. Due
to the characteristic of the consensus algorithm, the attacker
needs to control the central bank and most of the node,
otherwise, the network can correct errors itself. Relatively,
if the attacker has controlled most of the nodes exclude the

central bank, the central bank can also use its mandatory
operation to check and balance the attacker, finally fixs the
data after nodes being restored.
IV. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

The traditional digital currency architecture generally has the
problems of insufficient operating efficiency and excessive
resource consumption. Thus it is not suitable for CBDC
that requires high throughput. The high-efficiency blockchain
architecture represented by the alliance chain has excellent
performance and modular architecture. But its application
scenarios and some design concepts are not compatible with
CBDC. Therefore, the architecture design proposed in this
paper is optimized based on the alliance chain.
A customized structured and modular alliance chain architecture for CBDC is proposed as the network layer. Different
from using the unified wallet in traditional blockchain architecture, nodes are divided into types in our design. They are
responsible for consensus, account processing, and UTXO
processing. To improve the concurrent processing capability,
a sliced storage solution is proposed to optimize the data
management, and the working scope of nodes with the same
type are independent and concurrent. This part is introduced
in the next chapter.
A. OVERALL STRUCTURAL DESIGN

The overall architecture design principles are as follows:
1) The architecture should strengthen the regulatory nature
of digital currencies so that central banks and governments
can conduct data accounting easily.
2) The architecture must have efficient transaction processing capabilities, especially to ensure the conduct of basic
payment transactions.
3) The construction difficulty and cost of the architecture
cannot be too high.
Based on the above principles, the digital currency architecture designed in this article is shown in Fig. 7. The architecture adopts a modular idea and divides the system into six
levels, application layer, enter layer, third-level node, secondVOLUME 9, 2021

level node, first-level node, and core data center. The application layer is the entrance of the transaction, which consists of
users, operable wallets, and web interfaces. It sends the generated transaction requests to the entrance layer through RPC,
HTTP, 5G and other methods. The enter layer is composed of
some urban infrastructure, base stations, and agent nodes. It is
responsible for distributing transactions, especially account
transactions to secondary nodes, and asset transactions to
tertiary nodes. The second-level node is composed of special nodes maintained by the city and state-level information
departments, operators, etc. It is mainly responsible for the
processing and sequencing of account transactions. The thirdlevel node is composed of commercial banks, digital currency
application provider companies, financial institutions, and
network service provider companies. It is mainly responsible
for the processing and sequencing of digital asset transactions, and it can be synchronized with the second-level nodes
at any time. The first-level nodes are mainly maintained and
managed by provincial governments. It is responsible for
block production and data consensus. The core data center
does not participate in the operation of the blockchain. It is
mainly responsible for backing up, supervising and saving the
final valid data, and managing the first-level nodes.
B. THE MODULAR DESIGN OF THE ARCHITECTURE

According to the above analysis, our architecture does not
use the fully quantized node method of traditional blockchain
but divides it into six levels based on the modular idea.
This allows maintainers to deploy equipment as needed at all
levels. We introduce each level in the architecture in detail
below.
1) APPLICATION LAYER

The application layer directly contacts with users. It is a kind
of digital currency transaction application software running
on electronic devices, for instance, mobile phones and computers. The application layer is usually used as a wallet in
the blockchain, which is responsible for key management,
signature, transaction generation, and some other functions.
In this design, considering the security and applicability of
digital currency, we divide wallets into official wallets and
third-party wallets. The official wallet contains private key
management and encryption implementation. It must further
call the interface of the official wallet for the actions need
to call the private key or the identification information of
users, which include signing, verification, and other actions
in the third-party wallet. Its structure and function are shown
in Fig. 8.
2) ENTER LAYER

The enter layer consists of communication infrastructures
such as switches and servers. It is mainly maintained by
equipment suppliers and network operators. The architecture
of the enter layer is shown in Fig. 9. The enter layer does not
participate in transaction settlement and data maintenance.
Its main functions include: ¬ Pre-checking the submitted

format and protocol are correct; ­ Sorting the second-level
nodes and the third-level nodes with different responsibilities,
and ensuring the load balance of the nodes in the large-scale
transaction scenario. ® Making preliminary statistics on the
transactions submitted in the network, recording and limit the
number of repeated transactions.
3) SECOND-LEVEL NODE

The second-level node is the core of handling account transactions. It stores all account data and related transaction data
in a distributed manner according to the region where users
and enterprises are registered. The second-level node is maintained by the local government or officially authorized network operator, Internet service provider, commercial bank,
etc. Therefore, the transaction processing scope between different second-level nodes is distinctive. The data recorded
by the second-level node is a subset of the main chain’s
ledger, called the main ledger. However, the second-level
node cannot directly rewrite the main ledger. The main ledger
can only be updated after the blockchain is synchronized.
On other side, the second-level node also records a pre-ledger.
The deductions for processing transactions are carried out on
the pre-ledger to ensure the node can still process subsequent

transactions before the transaction is finally confirmed on the
chain.
The overall architecture of the second-level node is
shown in Fig. 10. The second-level node needs to receive
information from different levels, including service query
requests from the application layer, data synchronization and
transaction pull requests from the first-level node, account
transactions from the entrance layer, and asset transaction
information from third-level nodes, etc.
4) THIRD-LEVEL NODE

Because the flexible functions of digital assets and the high
demand for computer resources, third-level nodes are needed
to maintain and manage them for developers. Each digital
asset can only be handled by one third-level node. However,
data backup can be negotiated between the third-level nodes
to ensure data security under special circumstances.

FIGURE 11. Third-level node architecture.

The messages that the third-level node may receive from
other levels include: ¬ The query requests from the application layer; ­ The data synchronization and transaction pull
requests from the first-level nodes; ® The asset transaction
requests from the enter layer; ¯ The contract confirmation
returned from the second-level nodes. The functional architecture of the third-level node is shown in Fig. 11.

FIGURE 12. First-level node architecture.

5) FIRST-LEVEL NODE

The first-level node is mainly responsible for the final legality
verification of the transaction. The production of the block
and consensus does not involve the operation of the transaction. The first-level nodes are operated and maintained
by provincial governments or central banks. The primary
node maintains complete blockchain ledger data, including
all accounts, assets, and transaction records. In particular,
the ledger between all the first-level nodes must be consistent, to ensure that the correction is made by the minority
in the majority when the fork occurs. Each first-level node
administers a large number of second-level nodes and thirdlevel nodes, and is responsible for the data synchronization
of subordinate nodes. This hierarchical management model
can distribute network pressure and improve the overall performance of the system.
The overall architecture of the first-level node is shown
in Fig. 12. First-level nodes need to actively pull account
transaction data from second-level nodes, asset transaction
data from third-level nodes, transaction group data from other
first-level nodes, and consensus information from other firstlevel nodes.
C. SLICED DATA STORAGE DESIGN

It can lead to a decrease in transaction processing performance when the UTXO solution is applied to digital assets.
And UTXO fragmentation can also generate greater storage
pressure. A sliced data storage scheme is used to solve the
above problems, as shown in Fig. 13. The design can preVOLUME 9, 2021

FIGURE 13. Data storage scheme.

vent secondary nodes from storing redundant data that is not
commonly used in transaction processing, make these nonconsensus nodes back up data on demand, and then greatly
saving construction and maintenance costs.
In this schema, both the core data center and the first-level
nodes maintain a complete blockchain database. The firstlevel node is the production node of the block. It saves the
main chain that performs blockchain consensus and updates
every cycle. The core data center backs up the primary nodes
asynchronously. When performing data backup, the results
recorded on the main chain must be reviewed. When abnormal or illegal records occur, instructions such as freezing and
correction must be issued to the first-level nodes. Therefore,
the core data center usually lags behind the data of the firstlevel node, but it is the final valid data. The second-level
node only stores account data and related transaction data.
The content stored by each second-level node is a subset
53597

J. Zhang et al.: Hybrid Model for Central Bank Digital Currency Based on Blockchain

of the complete ledger of the first-level node, which is not
intersected in theory. So all the second-level nodes have the
same functions but different processing scopes. The thirdlevel node only stores the asset data about its operation,
the related account data and transaction data. The asset data
stored in the third-level node is also a subset of the first-level
node’s ledger and not intersected with each other. However,
the account data stored in the third-level node can be a subset
of a second-level node or the sum of multiple second-level
node subsets. The design takes into account that digital assets
can be held by different accounts across secondary nodes.
Under the storage scheme, each transaction can be uniquely
processed to a node at a certain time. The server in the entry
layer records the processing address of each transaction in
the form of a dynamic routing table. It can be assigned to the
corresponding processing node, when the transaction passes
through the entry layer,.
FIGURE 14. The operation process of POA-PBFT.

V. CONSENSUS MECHAINSM

Considering the disadvantages of the traditional blockchain
mechanism and the characteristics of CBDC, we think DPOS
and PBFT is suitable for this scene. We tend to use the DPOSBFT consensus that votes to several block producers consenting with a PBFT way to transfer blocks and determining the
order of production. We, therefore, propose a novel consensus
algorithm called POA-PBFT, based on the improvement of
the DPOS-BFT algorithm. In this section, we introduce the
mechanism of the POA-PBFT and the improvement compared with the DPOS-BFT.
A. POA-PBFT
1) THE ELECTION MECHANISM

We changed the election of the bookkeeping node from voting by all blockchain participants to direct appointment and
removal by the central bank. In this way, the voting consumption can be removed, and the position of producers could
be more stable to reduce the time of network change. And
there is no need for candidate nodes to deploy the producing
facilities. Besides, a shutdown node can be replaced by a
candidate node immediately in DPOS. In our design, other
nodes can temporarily replace the work of the shutdown node.
2) THE BLOCK PRODUCTION SEQUENCE

The production order of the blocks in DPOS is negotiated by
all producers and the block number increased freely. In POAPBFT, however, a certain node specified by the central bank
can produce a fixed block number block. When a node is
delayed and the next node cannot receive the block, the next
node cannot use the number of the delayed block as in DPOS.
This can effectively avoid the generation of forked chains.
3) THE PROCESS OF SHUTDOWN

Once a node shuts down and cannot notify all other nodes,
the central bank finds the lack of the block accurately when
it synchronizes data a few blockchain periods behind the
53598

network, and checks the node, and notify other nodes actively.
After that, the network eliminates the invalid block number
and keep running. Before this node is repaired, other nodes
can temporarily replace its work. So the reduction of the
processing capability caused by the shutdown can only last
for a few block periods.
To solve the fork problem due to delay, DPOS-BFT needs
two rounds of consensus [30]. We avoid the fork, and the
system performance can only drop for several periods of the
block before the central bank checks it in our design. This
optimization can remove one round of consensus and almost
reduce half of the time consumption.
B. ANALYSIS OF THE CONSENSUS PROCESS

Fig. 14 shows the consensus process of the POA-PBFT algorithm. Assume that there are four producer nodes A, B, C,
and D in the network, the central bank has specified the order
of node producing and the block number. At this time, it is
the turn of node A to produce blocks. First, node A packages
the transaction groups consist of transactions pulled from
the subordinate node before generating the block. When the
block is generated, all the transaction groups can be written
in a new block. The block is only a pre-block in node A and
has not been recognized by the network. After node A signs
the block, it can be broadcast to other producer nodes: B, C,
and D. They can first store the block in cache and check the
validity. If the verification passes, they can return node A their
signature of the block. After node A collects 2/3 of the node’s
signatures, the block reaches an irreversible state. After that,
node A can generate a signature set and broadcast it to others
again, and then place the block with the signature into the
chain. At this point, the next block period is ready, even if
other nodes had no time to write the block. Because there are
2/3 node confirmations on the block of node A, the block is
legal. After receiving the signature set, B, C, and D verify the

signature set, take out the blocks from the cache and place
them in the local chain.

TABLE 2. Experimental configuration.

VI. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS
A. SECURITY ANALYSIS

The security analysis of the hybrid model for CBDC we
proposed mainly includes two aspects: model security and
transaction security. Model security is guaranteed by the
storage scheme and consensus mechanism. And the operation
mechanism and supervision mode we designed can ensure
transaction security.
1) MODEL SECURITY

In terms of data storage of our model, the central bank’s core
data nodes and the first-level nodes keep the complete records
of transactions, accounts, and digital assets. The second-level
nodes keep the records of transaction and account after data
slicing, which are allocated according to permissions. And
the three-level nodes save the account data without privacy
and the records of assets and transactions about the node
operation company. This sliced date storage scheme not only
reduces the diffusion of sensitive data but also decreases the
redundancy of data storage. Therefore, we can improve the
security of the system and also facilitate the central bank’s
supervision.
At the same time, the POA-PBFT we proposed is still
essentially a state machine replication algorithm. It guarantees liveness and provable safety and provides partly fault
tolerance. The specific proof process can refer to [31].
2) TRANSACTION SECURITY

Different from the general digital currency, CBDC is not a
financial product for speculation. It is used for the whole
society rather than a specific community. Therefore, its safety
largely depends on the regulatory mechanism.
We adopt the ‘‘single-core’’ supervision mode that uses
the central bank as the core, supplemented by the alliance
chain. The core data center of the central bank is the node
with the highest authority. It does not participate in the bookkeeping of the alliance chain, but responsible for the supervision of nodes, including data synchronization and analysis.
We demonstrate the details of this supervision mode to ensure
transaction security in part III above.
B. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

In order to test the architecture, we implemented a blockchain
experimental platform in Java. The platform equipped with
a series of minimized blockchain nodes based on different
operating mechanisms. It ran on a physical server when all
the nodes running in Docker. Communication between nodes
used a JSON-based P2P protocol, and the network latency
was randomly simulated and could be dynamically adjusted.
We used xxHash algorithm and SM2 encryption algorithm
in the experiment. Other configurations are shown in the
following Table 2.
VOLUME 9, 2021

FIGURE 15. Time consumption of different modes.

First, We tested the processing time required by three types
of nodes (UTXO, Account, and Mixed) when processingintensive transactions. To ensure that nodes are running at
full capacity, intensive transactions are generated by the random transaction generator in a Poisson distribution when
the density of transactions can be adjusted based on node’s
buffer pool load. In mixed mode, the ratio of UTXO to
Account is 2: 8, which is higher than the actual situation. The
experimental results are shown in Fig. 15. When intensive
transactions continue to increase, the processing time of different solutions increases linearly. Under the same conditions,
the average time consumption of the UTXO mode is 28.5%
higher than that of the Account scheme. The mixed-mode can
reduce the average time consumption taken by the UTXO
mode by 16.4%. This proves that the performance of the
mixed-mode is further improved when the ratio is close to
2: 13 in the real situation.
Next, under the mixed-mode, we tested the time consumption of traditional network architecture and the improved network architecture in processing-intensive transactions. The
experimental results are shown in Fig. 16 with the same
conditions in the previous experiment. When the number
of intensive transactions increases, the processing time of
both architectures increases linearly. Compared with the traditional blockchain architecture, the architecture solution we
proposed has reduced the average processing time of intensive transactions by about 26.3%.
Finally, we tested the time required for the PBFT algorithm
and the POA-PBFT algorithm to complete a round of con53599

anism of the issuance, circulation, and return of CBDC is
comprehensively designed in this scheme. This hybrid model
of UTXO and account improves the processing rate by 16.4%
compared with UTXO. And the transaction processing speed
is improved by 26.3% using the network architecture. With
the improvement of the consensus algorithm, the consensus
speed is improved by more than 51.8%.
There are still some problems to be solved. For example, the implementation of smart contracts and related
experiments have not been carried out due to experimental
conditions and manpower constraints. Therefore, the optimization effect of smart contracts theory needs to be verified
by subsequent experiments. And we didn’t study how to
use the system for currency regulation and investment at the
national policy level. Although it is not a technical issue, it is
one of the research focuses on digital currency systems.

sensus under different numbers of nodes. We set the average
network delay of nodes to 20 milliseconds. We have made
a lot of experiments on a different number of nodes. The
abnormal data were eliminated and the results were averaged.
The experimental results are shown in Fig. 17. The consensus
time of the PBFT algorithm increases exponentially, while
POA-PBFT algorithm shows similar linear growth. When
the number of first-level nodes is between 30 and 50, the
optimization makes obvious improvement. The performance
of POA-PBFT algorithm is improved by 51.8% to 64.7%
compared with PBFT algorithm.
Experimental results show that mixed-mode can significantly improve processing efficiency while retaining UTXO
characteristics, and the structured and modular network architecture can further increase transaction processing speed.
At the same time, POA-PBFT algorithm can greatly reduce
the time consumption of consensus compared with PBFT.

architecture, and consensus mechanism. The operation mech53600
