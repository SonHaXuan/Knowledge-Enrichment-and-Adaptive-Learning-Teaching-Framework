The study focuses on identifying the driving forces behind the digital transformation of the economy in the financial
sector and the development of the digital financial assets (DFA) market. The subject of the research is the factors
of digital transformation and the DFA market. The relevance is due to the transformation of the world economy,
associated, among other things, with the active development of the DFA market, the expansion of the possibilities
of using distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and blockchain against the background of high growth rates of the
cryptoasset market. The aim of the paper is to summarize the main trends in the development of the global cryptoasset
market, determine the main factors of investment attractiveness of cryptocurrencies and explore the conditions for the
successful implementation of various models of digital currencies of central banks (CBDC). In the course of the work, the
methods of systematization and classification of information, multivariate statistical analysis were used. As a result of
the study, 5 clusters of cryptocurrencies were identified, depending on the dominance in the market and the dynamics
of price changes. The resulting functions can be used to predict the attribution of cryptocurrencies to the corresponding
clusters. Among the factors that have a significant impact on the development of CBDC projects in general and with
the wholesale model in particular, one can single out “capital”. At the same time, CBDC projects with a retail model
are actively and successfully implemented in countries with a high level of technical knowledge and entrepreneurial
talent, ahead of the capital factor in their importance. Taking into account the review of global trends, the development
of fintech technologies, it was concluded that the processes of digitalization of financial assets are inevitable, the
emergence of new forms of digital assets that dictate the need for the advanced development of their legal regulation.
