                                                                The objective of the research was to assess the potential risks
                                                            of stable CBDC digital currencies,alsoknown as coins, for global
                                                            financial security.. For several years we have seen the phenomenon
                                                            of «de-dollarization» in the international financial market; this is
                                                            a gradual transition in abandoning the use of the US dollar in
                                                            central bank payments and reserves. A key step in the strategy of
                                                            freeing countries from the US dollar was the creation of national
                                                            digital currencies, i.e. stable CBDC currencies. To systematize
                                                 the data obtained, methods of functional and institutional classification,
                                                 statisticalanalysisand, also, retrospective, currentand future methods of
                                                 analysis and synthesis of theoretical and practical material were used.. It is
                                                 concludedthat the rejection of the stable currency Libra was motivated by
                                                 the possibility of its transformation into a competing system of traditional
                                                 currencies. The emergence of a private CBDC prompted central banks and
                                                 regional associations to create their own CBDCs that could compete with
                                                 the US dollar in international payments. However, the emergence of CBDC
                                                 is associated with undeniable advantages and objective risks to the existing
                                                 financial system and its security.

      Evaluación de los riesgos potenciales de monedas
      digitales nacionales estables para la seguridad
                     financiera mundial
Resumen
    El objetivo de la investigación fue evaluar los riesgos potenciales de
monedas digitales estables CBDC, también conocidas como coins, para la
seguridad financiera mundial. Desde hace varios años se observa el fenómeno
de la “desdolarización” en el mercado financiero internacional; se trata una
transición gradual en el abandono del uso del dólar estadounidense en los
pagos y reservas mundiales de los bancos centrales. Un paso fundamental en
la estrategia de liberar a los países del dólar estadounidense fue la creación
de monedas digitales nacionales, es decir, monedas estables CBDC. Para
sistematizar los datos obtenidos, se utilizaron métodos de clasificación
funcional e institucional, análisis estadístico y, también, métodos de
análisis y síntesis retrospectivos, actuales y futuros de material
teórico y práctico. Se concluye que el rechazo de la moneda estable Libra
estuvo motivado por la posibilidad de su transformación en un sistema
competidor de las monedas tradicionales. La aparición de una CBDC
privada impulsó a los bancos centrales y las asociaciones regionales a crear
sus propias CBDC que podrían competir con el dólar estadounidense en los
pagos internacionales. Sin embargo, la aparición de CBDC se asocia con
ventajas innegables y riesgos objetivos para el sistema financiero existente
y su seguridad.

                                  Introduction


    The virtually unlimited possibilities in the financial sector opened by
digitalization are actively transforming not only financial institutions and
instruments but also leading to a qualitative review of existing relationships
in the financial sector. The introduction of digital institutions and alternative
systems of interstate settlements based on the “blockchain” technology
can usher in a new stage in the development of the international financial
system (Begishev and Khisamova, 2018; Begishev et al., 2020).
   The Western European states have no will to move to a multipolar world
where the injustice of the global financial and economic architecture exists;
the latter does not take into account the growing influence of emerging
market economies. This injustice could be eliminated through the reform of

key institutions of the Bretton Woods system (the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group). The unwillingness mentioned
above has predetermined the need for developed countries in creating
alternative financial systems.
   This problem became particularly acute in the context of the “tough”
sanctions policy of the Western European countries and the United States
of America (USA) against Russia and the active trade war between the USA
and China, which was named among the key threats to the stability of the
global financial system.
   Separately, it is worth noting the growing role of transnational
corporations and tech giants such as Facebook, which saw in new financial
instruments the opportunity to significantly expand their sphere of influence
on the financial relationships of users.
   The harsh criticism of Facebook from most countries for its trying
to create its own digital currency, Libra, was also added with threats of
using tough sanctions policy against companies that co-founded Libra, in
particular, such payment giants like Visa, MasterCard, Stripe and eBay.
This, ultimately, led to their withdrawal from the project in view of the
“blurring of the regulation boundaries of the stable coin” (Fusaro and
Hougan, 2019).
    Central banks have said that Facebook’s potentially huge cross-border
payment coverage will make it instantly a systemic competitor to traditional
currencies. In turn, the European Central Bank (ECB) has banned the
circulation of the stable-coin of the Libra type until the creation of an
effective regulatory mechanism for their circulation.
   The creation of Libra provided a new impetus to the development of
the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) concept. Some countries began
actively introducing bans on stable-coins, while others, on the contrary,
intensified their development in the field of creating state cryptocurrencies
(Corbet et al., 2018).
    A report by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for the Group of Seven
(G7) notes that global the stable-coin pose a threat to the global financial
system and their launch is impossible until legal, regulatory and supervisory
risks would be addressed.
   The concept of financial security is the subject of interdisciplinary research.
In the legal literature, there are several approaches to understanding this
concept, however, in our opinion, the most comprehensive approach to
understanding financial security was proposed by Vorobyov and Poritsky
(Vorobyov and Poritsky, 2015). As E.V. Kudryashova rightly notes,
economic science and management to date have proposed qualitative
and quantitative criteria for assessing the level of financial security
                                                 CUESTIONES POLÍTICAS

(Kudryashova, 2019). There is a direct correlation between financial and
economic security. Financial security should be considered as part of
economic security and, ultimately, as a component of national security, and
one of its key components, because lowering the level of financial security
can lead to loss of financial stability and solvency by the state (Khabrieva,
2016). In this regard, the assessment of potential risks of the impact on the
financial security of a new financial instrument, such as the stable-coin, is
of particular importance.
   In a new report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on
digital payments, central banks are encouraged to consider CBDC as “their
future.” It is noted that the release of CBDC could lead to serious changes in
the financial ecosystem.
   Within the framework of this paper, the authors attempted to analyse
the essence of stablecoins as a new financial instrument and to assess
the potential and imaginary risks associated with their spread for global
financial security.


                         1. Materials and methods


    The study is based on a wide range of international sources, as well as
data from international organizations, national legislation and scientific
literature. As part of the study, we analysed official documents of Group
of Twenty (G20), G7, FSB, at European Union (EU) aimed at assessing the
threats posed by stablecoins to the global economy.
    During the study, methods of system analysis, dialectic and its
derivatives, methods and principles of determinism, induction, deduction
and hypothesis were successfully applied. To systematize the obtained data,
methods of functional and institutional classification, statistical analysis,
and also methods of retrospective, current and future analysis and synthesis
of theoretical and practical material were used.


                                  2. Results


    CBDC represents digital financial assets issued by central banks.
Exaggeratedly speaking, the main difference between CBDC and traditional
fiat money is that CBDC is a central bank obligation expressed in existing
payment units, which can serve as a means of exchange (settlement), storage
of value and payment method, that is, to fulfil all fiat money functions,
however, operating on the basis of blockchain technology.

160      Assessment of Potential Risks of Regional for Global Financial Security


   CBDCs are a special case of the stable-coins, which are understood as a
digital financial asset, the current value of which is provided by one of the
traditional and liquid types of assets, i.e. with currency, commodity values,
assets accepted in world financial practice, as a reliable and legal means of
calculation.
   Traditionally, it is customary to distinguish three varieties of stable coins:
those secured by a fiat currency or other liquid assets (Tether, TrueUSD,
USDC); secured by cryptocurrency, where tokens/coins (MakerDAO) are
used as a security deposit instead of the fiat currency, and not secured
coins, where the nominal value is ensured thanks to the work of a smart
contract (Nabilou, 2019).
   In turn, there are four groups of coins in the report of the ECB:
      - Tokenized coins (Tether, USD Coin, Paxos, etc.), which are secured
        by assets held by the issuer in custody;
   -    Stablecoins with off-chain support (Sweetbridge) by the issuer with
        assets of other traditional classes;
      - Stablecoins provided by on-chain assets (i.e. crypto assets Dai,
        Aurora);
      - Algorithmic stable-coins provided by the work of a smart contract
        (NuBits).
   ECB stable-coins pegged to fiat currencies are described as digital units of
value, while they are not a form of any particular currency; however, they rely
on a certain set of stabilization instruments to minimize price fluctuations.
According to the report, “tokenized coins” in the ECB classification are the
most common type of stable-coins: they account for almost 97% of the total
trading volume. The specified asset class also includes CBDC.
    The emergence of stable-coins in general, and CBDC in particular, is due
to the desire of participants in the financial market to use the opportunities
and advantages offered by the blockchain to provide financial services; this
was clearly demonstrated by cryptocurrencies, while reducing to zero the
main disadvantages of cryptocurrencies, such as their high volatility and
anonymity, which deprive their use as an equivalent alternative to a fiat
currency (Sidorenko, 2019).
   On the contrary, the predictable rate of the stable-coins allows us to
make calculations even by long-term contracts between counterparties, to
avoid a sharp devaluation of the coin (including through the manipulation
of insider information in the financial markets), and use them as an
equivalent replacement for the fiat currency.

   Most CBDCs are designed for general use, although some are used solely
for bulk payments and settlements between central banks. In relation to
CBDC, three models of access for their implementation are distinguished:
   - Access only for financial institutions (Model FI)
   - Access for the whole economy (Model EW)
   - Access for financial institutions, plus limited access to banks
     supported by CBDC (Model FI+).
    It is worth noting that digital currency of a central bank cannot match
all the canons of cryptocurrencies, such as decentralization, change by
voting, branching or the emergence of a new currency (fork), free purchase/
sale. The CBDC concept and the underlying distributed ledger technology
(DLT) technology are today in the plane of a controversial discussion of
their impact on the existing financial system. On the one hand, the objective
advantages of DLT-based CBDCs are indisputable, which will allow central
banks to reduce the use of cash, ensure 24/7 system availability, reduce
transaction costs and terms, minimize costs and improve trade. Stablecoins
also has undoubted benefits for exchanges, as they increase its level of
decentralization and make the market drop not so significant for investors,
and finally, if a stable-coin is well implemented, it can easily replace the US
dollar in settlements.
     Undoubtedly, the mega regulator of all countries see these advantages;
it is confirmed by a close study of the issue of launching CBDC on their part.
   BIS and FSB express serious concerns about the risks of launching a
CBDC, in particular, about how fundamental the impact of the introduction
of CBDC on the existing financial ecosystem will turn out, which ultimately
casts doubt on the role of banks in financing economic activities and makes
their universal release unlikely in the short term. In February 2019 FSB
chairman Randal Quarles stated that stable-coins could challenge any
financial structure, so G20 member countries should actively implement
FATF standards for stable-coins.
   Among the key risks for the global financial system, the G7 report notes
the following:
   1) The expansion of the circle of customers (the transition from a model
       of interaction with commercial banks to a multi-user audience)
       entails a significant increase in operational risks for central banks;
   2) Difficulties in complying with the principles of Anti-Money Laundering
      (AML)/ Know Your Customer (KYC);
   3) Replacing the functionality of commercial banks (payment processing)
       with blockchain, and as a result, a complete drop-in bank income;

          y Ildar Rustamovich Begishev
162       Assessment of Potential Risks of Regional for Global Financial Security


      4) Difficulties in the p2p (peer-to-peer) lending system and in
         determining interest rates;
      5) Containment of competition and a threat to financial stability if users
         suddenly lose confidence in digital currency.
    In a separate letter to the G20 finance ministers, FSB Chairman Randal
Quarles also noted that all these challenges “must be addressed as a matter
of priority”.
    On April 14, 2020, the FSB provided general recommendations
on regulating stable-coins. Thus, stable-coins must meet the same
requirements that are followed by other organizations that carry similar
risks, regardless of the technology used. That is, the DUE DILIGENCE and
KYC/AML procedures should be strictly applied to stable-coins, which will
allow at least partially to eliminating the risks. At the same time, it is noted
that control over stable-coins used for making international payments is
complicated by differences in financial regulation of different countries.
    States are encouraged to be flexible and develop a common standard
for regulating digital currencies so that their issuers cannot move from one
jurisdiction to another. If necessary, the authorized bodies should specify
regulation and eliminate possible gaps in the domestic legal system in
order to effectively minimize the risks posed by international stable-coins.
Special attention in the recommendations is given to stable-coin operators.
Operators of stable cryptocurrencies must take measures for the effective
management of risks and the stable operation of their system. In particular,
they are required to provide protection against cyberattacks, to combat
money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Also, according to the
FSB, the possibility of free transactions using stable-coins is a serious threat
to financial stability.
   Meanwhile, it is worth dwelling on the distinctive advantage of CBDC,
which takes on the nature of a problem in the global socio-political context.
The spread of CBDC is able to streamline cross-border payments and create
seamless trade without borders, which in turn means increased competition
for global trade and, consequently, increased sovereignty over the global
economy.


                                       3. Discussion


   As countries around the world continue to research and test the digital
currencies of their central banks, it becomes increasingly apparent that the
dominance of the US dollar can be called into question after the concept
would be fully implemented on a regional scale. The US dollar remains an

                               Vol. 38 Nº Especial (1era parte 2020): 156-166   163

undisputed “king” when it comes to international trade. According to the
International Monetary Fund, as of 2019, about 61% of all foreign exchange
reserves are allocated in dollars. Similarly, the sovereign currency of the
United States serves as the primary vehicle for cross-border transactions,
even for transactions in which the United States itself is not involved.
    While most CBDC retailers focus on domestic economic issues, some
projects focus on promoting trade in a specific region, creating a digital
alternative to the US dollar.
    Examples of such stablecoins are a regional stablecoin supported by a
basket of currencies, including Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, South Korean
Won and Hong Kong Dollar, which will allow East Asian countries to get
rid of the hegemony of the US dollar. However, the support of CBDC with
the national currencies of various states creates significant difficulties
in providing the system, conducting KYC/AML procedures, as well as
determining the centralized CBDC issuer and operator. Another example
of a regional CBDC is the digital CBDC euro. The concept is most actively
explored by the French Central Bank, Banque de France.
    One of the main participants in the unofficial CBDC race is the digital
yuan, a digital currency that is being actively developed by the People’s
Bank of China. According to the representative of the Chinese Central
Bank, the “digital yuan” can be used on such large payment platforms as
WeChat and Alipay. The security of China’s cryptocurrency will be similar
to that offered by paper money. In this case, the asset can be used without
an Internet connection.
   Challenging the dollar as a world trade currency is possible only if
the base currency of the indicated CBDC is already the main world trade
currency. The digital yuan is one of the few CBDC projects that have a real
opportunity to squeeze the dollar because of China’s trade relations and the
great number of China’s partners, which are scattered around the world,
and the scale of world trade taking place with China.
   It is noteworthy that the United States is also considering the possibility
of placing its national currency on blockchain rails, which, if implemented
correctly and quickly, can completely stop many competing projects.
    Another alternative was the idea of creating a supranational CBDC for
BRICS. At the beginning of 2018, the Russian Central Bank and Russian
President V. Putin proposed to create an international digital currency
common to the BRICS and the EAEU. Among the key advantages of such
an initiative, there is the possibility of replacing the SWIFT system with
blockchain technology, which will underlie such digital currency, as well as
its lower susceptibility to possible devaluation in contrast to the national
currencies already used in mutual trade settlements.

164    Assessment of Potential Risks of Regional for Global Financial Security


    The potential implementation of such a project could make it possible to
ensure significant efficiency of trade relations within the group by reducing
transaction costs, increasing their reliability, and in the future by completely
changing the structure of trade relations through the introduction of
blockchain technology and smart contracts. Such an idea looks particularly
attractive against the background of news about the launch in the test mode
of CBDC by the World Bank and the IMF to study the possibilities of digital
assets and blockchain.
   However, there are serious doubts about the real possibility of
implementing such an initiative, first of all, in view of the diametrical
opposite of the national approaches represented by developing countries
to the regulation of digital currencies. It should be noted that the delay
in creating a “single digital environment of trust” based on interstate
agreements demonstrated against the background of the constant
distancing of the national approaches shown by the countries of the group
in the issue of regulating digital financial assets virtually eliminates the
possibility of implementing such an initiative. The absence of a single agreed
position on the legal nature of CBDC and its implementation strategy at
the international level is reflected in the quality of national legal regulation
of virtual currency (Shuvalov et al., 2017; Burnie, 2018; Carstens, 2019;
Ciaian and Rajcaniova, 2018).
    In brief it should be mentioned that the payment requirements and
customer identity verification will allow at least partially eliminating the
risks (Constâncio, 2018; Khisamova et al., 2019; Begishev and Khisamova,
2018; Khisamova and Begishev, 2019; Begishev et al., 2020; Khisamova et
al., 2020; Corbet et al., 2018; Haig, 2017).


                                      Conclusion


   Digital innovations in the financial sector contribute to faster, cheaper,
and more inclusive payments. The benefits that the CBDC have can
significantly transform the global economic environment, reduce existing
costs and stimulate the growth of the global economy thanks to access to
markets for a wide range of entities. IMF insists on using CBDC to expand
access to financial services, especially in poor countries where financial
institutions are underdeveloped and not always accessible. However,
such advantages can be realized only if there is a properly developed and
regulated procedure for implementing CBDC. The rules applicable in the
traditional financial industry must be applied to them. We are talking about
payment requirements and customer identity verification. This will allow at
least partially eliminating the risks.

    The global scaling of CBDC creates important problems and risks
related to financial stability, monetary policy, guarantees to prevent money
laundering and terrorist financing, as well as protecting consumers and
investors from risks. However, control over stablecoins used to carry out
international payments is complicated by differences in financial regulation
of different countries. Digitalization of the economy is inextricably linked
with the globalization of financial and economic regulation, and the need to
solve a number of emerging problems, which is possible only in conditions
of interaction at the interstate level.
