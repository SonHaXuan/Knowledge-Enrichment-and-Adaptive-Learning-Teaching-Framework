This paper investigates the interaction and the directional predictability between the central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs) and the major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins during the period
between 17 May, 2019–31 December, 2021. To this aim, we employ the "Cross-Quantilogram”
model, to examine how and whether the traditional digital currencies react to the CBDC uncer­
tainty and attention shocks. Our findings suggest that CBDC uncertainty index is negatively
related to cryptocurrency and stablecoin returns. Furthermore, the CBDC attention index is
negatively associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD, however, it is positively
related to Tether, Binance, USD Coin and Dai. Our results are useful for regulators, investors and
policy makers, to understand and assess the potential effect of CBDC adoption news on the
volatility of the stablecoins and traditional cryptos.

1. Introduction
Blockchain technology and decentralized finance have led to new forms of digital currencies over the past decade (Hoang et al.,
2023). Indeed, the huge success of Bitcoin, considered as the most prominent crypto asset, and the rise of new forms of virtual cur­
rencies have revived the debate among investors, and policymakers, about its usefulness as an alternative to fiat currencies and its
effect on other financial assets.
The ongoing digitalization has changed the means of payment, shaping the role of banks and the future of financial intermediation
(Tata, F, 2023). Simultaneously, many central banks, including the United States Federal Reserve and the People’s Bank of China, are
currently developing and issuing public digital forms of fiat currency, leading to the introduction of central bank digital currency
(CBDC), and providing a public instrument of payment with the same features of digital currencies that are still unregulated.
According to the IMF, CBDCs are considered “a widely accessible digital form of fiat money available to the public, that could be
legal tender”, (Kiff et al., 2020). Like traditional central bank money (coins and notes), CBDC would be an alternative to fiat currency
(Krylov et al., 2018 and Yao, 2018b). As new variants of public central bank money, CBDCs differ from central bank reserve of cash
(Boar et al., 2020).

Compared with other cryptocurrencies, the implementation of CBDC has several potential benefits. For instance, it improves the
control of money laundering and illicit payments, saves costs, provides additional instruments of payment to the public, and
strengthens the resilience of the payment system. However, the introduction of CBDC could rebuild the financial system architecture,
redefine the role of financial intermediaries and challenge the international payment systems (Brunnermeier et al., 2019). Among all
central bank projects on CBDC, China is the most advanced country in creating its own CBDC (Auer et al., 2020). The Bahamas and
Uruguay recently completed technical tests to implement their CBDC.
These recent developments, have sparked extensive debate and garnered attention among economists, regulators, central banks
and academics to examine the merits and dangers of introducing CBDC as digital public money and its effect on the financial and the
monetary system.
In this context, a growing strand of research focuses on the qualitative characteristics, main models, and the technological inno­
vation of CBDC (Masciandaro, 2018; Kirkby, 2018; Qian, 2019; Kochergin, 2021; Cunha et al., 2021, 2021c; Wang et al., 2022). Other
studies focus on the privacy and security of CBDC (Pocher and Veneris, 2021; Borgonovo et al., 2021). Another strand of literature
examines the effect of CBDC on the financial system and monetary policy. Kuehnlenz et al. (2023) examine the effect of the creation of
CBDC on the US dollar and show that the introduction of CBDC will not affect the role of the US dollar considered as the key currency of
the international financial and monetary system. Through a qualitative study, Shen and Hou (2021) examined the impact of the launch
of CBDC on the monetary system in China and found that CBDC adoption can transform the monetary system if it is used on a large
scale. However, Davoodalhosseini (2021) showed that CBDC can bear interest rates. Sinelnikova-Muryleva (2020) argued that, during
financial crises, some agents prefer to transfer money using CBDC rather than commercial banks. Furthermore, Sissoko (2020) indi­
cated that some regulators consider CBDC as a stablecoin. Other studies found that CBDC has a positive effect on financial stability
(Copeland, 2020; Larina and Akimov, 2020; Buckley et al., 2021). Elsayed and Nasir (2022) explained the economic rationale of CBDC
and examined the impact of its implementation on financial stability, monetary policy transmission and inflation targeting.
Applying a four-sector DSGE model, Tong and Jiayou (2021) examined the economic consequences of using electronic payment
and digital currencies and found that CBDCs affect the systematic financial risk and the leverage ratio. In the same vein, using the same
method, Barrdear and Kumhof (2021), investigated the effect of issuing CBDC on macroeconomic indicators and showed that CBDC
issuance accounts for 30% of the GDP, and could be raised by 3% against government bonds. Laboure et al. (2021) studied the main
drivers of digital currencies and CBDC implementation and examined the effect of introducing cryptocurrencies to a diversified
portfolio. They also outlined the current status of CBDC adoption projects. Auer and Claessens (2021) examined how the crypto­
currency market reacts to regulatory actions and showed that the effect depends on the specific regulatory category. Using the case of
the Bank of England, Morgan (2022) argued the CBDC’s defensive role and its ability to avert the potential problems associated with
stablecoin.
Recently, Wang et al. (2022) developed two new CBDC indices, the CBDC uncertainty index (CBDCUI) and CBDC attention index
(CBDCAI) to examine the effect of CBDC news on financial markets. Applying a quantitative approach, based on the SVAR and
DCC-GJR-GARCH models, they found that CBDC indices are negatively and significantly related to the MSCI World Bank Index and the
FTSE All-World Index volatility. However, these indices are positively associated with the volatility of Bitcoin, VIX, forex markets, and
gold.
From a quantitative perspective, there is no consensus so far on the effect of the CBDC adoption on traditional cryptocurrencies and
stablecoins. Despite the growing interest of investors and policy makers in the implications of the CBDC for cryptocurrency and
financial markets, the recent literature on CBDC opportunities is still limited. Few studies have provided a rationale to consider the
response of traditional digital currencies to the CBDC uncertainty and attention shocks. The growing debate on CBDC implications
motivates us to use a quantitative approach to examine the reaction of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to CBDC news using a
quantitative approach. Specifically, none of the related studies has evaluated the effect of CBDC shocks on the cryptocurrency market
applying the Cross-Quantilogram method. Our study fills this gap in the literature and examines the directional predictability between
CBDC news and cryptocurrencies and stablecoins volatility providing new insights. We contribute to the existing studies and inves­
tigate the dependence and the interconnections between CBDC news and the returns on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. More
importantly, applying the Cross- Quantilogram technique, this paper identifies the predictability direction and analyses the key
channels through which the effects of this new asset are transferred to traditional crypto assets. Hence, we used two novel CBDC
indices, the CBDC attention index (CBDCAI) and the CBDC uncertainty index (CBDCUI), developed by Wang et al. (2022) to assess
CBDC variations and trends. Our sample includes the top eight cryptocurrencies and stablecoins from May 2019 to December 2021.
Applying the Cross-Quantilogram model to assesses the abnormal returns of the most prominent cryptocurrencies and stablecoins
around CBDC issuance, our results show that the CBDC uncertainty index is negatively related to cryptocurrency and stablecoin
returns. Specifically, if the CBDC uncertainty index is low, Bitcoin has a higher return during the following weeks. Our findings also
show that the CBDC attention index is also negatively associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD. However, Tether,
Binance, USD Coin and Dai are positively related to the CBDC attention index. Their returns are likely to decrease over the next few
weeks following a low attention index. However, when the indices are in their upper quantiles, the findings suggest that Bitcoin,
Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD are expected to realize losses in the following weeks when the uncertainty index is high and realize gains
when the attention index is high.
We contribute to the previous literature from a methodological perspective, using a framework that aims to assess the interaction
between CBDC indices and traditional crypto assets providing new evidence on how the volatility of the digital irregulated currencies is
affected by CBDC attention and uncertainty. Moreover, our findings give valuable insights on the dynamics between public and private
digital currencies. Information on the extent of the interaction between CBDC and traditional digital currencies and stablecoins is
important for investors, policy makers and regulators to assess the effect of its usefulness as an alternative to fiat currencies and adjust

Note: The table above presents the descriptive statistics of both the CBDC indices and the selected cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. It reports the
number of observations, minimum, maximum, median, mean, variance and standard deviation of each variable

their risk management strategies especially during financial crisis.
This study is presented as follows. Section 2 provides the data. Section 3 introduces and describes the methodology. Section 4
analyses and discusses the main findings. Section 5 concludes.
2. Data
Our study is based on two CBDC indices developed by Wang et al. (2022): the CBDC attention index (CBDCAI) and the CBDC
uncertainty index (CBDCUI). We also used the weekly closing prices of the top cryptocurrencies and stablecoins based on their market
capitalization (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance, USD Coin, XRP, Terra and Dai). CBDC indices data are collected from the study of
Wang et al. (2022); however, the weekly data on cryptos and stablecoins are obtained from coinmarketcap.com. The weekly data span
from 17 May, 2019–31 December, 2021.
The CBDC uncertainty index and the CBDC attention index were constructed by collecting data from LexisNexis News and Business
(Wang et al., 2022). According to the authors, this database provides a greater access to various publications from different sources and
time. Moreover, a process of standardization and normalization of these data is applied by the authors as this allows the data to be
sorted on the same scale.1
Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics for both CBDC indices and other digital currencies. The values indicate that the attention
index has an average return slightly higher than the uncertainty index. Moreover, the attention index is more volatile. Regarding the
digital currencies, Bitcoin has the largest mean return, followed by Ethereum, Terra, Dai, Tether, USD Coin, XPR and Binance. In other
words, Bitcoin has the highest performance, while Binance has the lowest. In terms of volatility, Bitcoin is the most volatile, while
Tether is the least. Among the other currencies, Ethereum is the most volatile, followed by Terra, XPR, Dai, USD Coin, Binance and
Tether. These results suggest that Bitcoin is expected to have the highest interaction with both indices. On one hand, it would attract
investors because it would be the best performing and on the other hand, it would be the most uncertain owing to its high volatility
compared with the other virtual currencies.
3. Methodology
3.1. The Quantilogram approach
The “Quantilogram” method was introduced by Linton and Whang (2007) to measure the predictability of financial assets returns
in different distribution parts of a stationary time series based on the correlogram of quantile hits. The null hypothesis supposes that
{ }
the past information of a stationary time series yt does not improve the prediction of yt , whether it will be above or below the
unconditional quantile. This test is based on the comparison of the “Quantilogram” to a pointwise confidence band.
According to Han et al. (2016), the “Quantilogram” approach has various advantages compared with other methodologies used to
detect predictability. First, this model can be easily interpreted as it is based on quantile hits and does not require moment conditions
1

The indices are calculated as follows:CBDCUI t =

(

N1t − μ1

σ1

)

+ 100where:

– CBDCUIt is the value of the CBDCUI in the week t,
– N1 t is the weekly observed value of news articles on LexisNexis concerning CBDC uncertainty,
– μ1 is the mean of these same articles,
– σ1 is the standard deviation of these articles.An average value of 100 is added to eliminate the potential negative impact caused by the total
volume of articles varying by publication source and time.The same formula and variables are applied for the CBDC Attention Index.

such as the ordinary correlogram. Therefore, it works well with heavy-tailed time series. Second, this framework allows us to use very
long lags in comparison with regression methods. Third, the “Quantilogram” is useful in cases where the null hypothesis of unpre­
dictability is assumed to be true and the degree of predictability of a time series across different quantiles can be measured. Moreover,
Han et al. (2016) developed this methodology using a multivariate series and allowed the “Quantilogram” to be based on conditional

quantiles. Both time series can be compared using this approach after controlling for the type of information at the time of prediction.
Additionally, the “Cross-Quantilogram” adds another dimension to analyse predictability compared with the linear quantile regres­
sion. Thus, it provides a comprehensive image of the relationship between the predictor and the predicted variable.

We use Fyi|xi (⋅|xit) to denote the conditional distribution function of the series yit. xit is a density function fyi|xi(⋅|xit), and the

We consider T as the range of quantiles; we are interested in evaluating the directional predictability. For simplicity, we assume
–
that T is a Cartesian product of two closed intervals in (0, 1), that is T –
– T1 × T2, where Ti = [τi , τi ] for some 0 < τi < τi < 1.
We also consider a measure of serial dependence between two events {y1 t ≤ q1,t(τ1)} and.
{y2,t− k ≤ q2,t− k(τ2)} for an arbitrary pair of τ = (τ1, τ2)T ∈ T and for an integer k.
In the literature, {1[yit ≤ qi,t(⋅)]} is called the quantile-hit or quantile-exceedance process for i = 1,2.
The “Cross Quantilogram” is defined as the cross-correlation of the quantile hit process:

4. Empirical results
4.1. Result interpretation
We used the “Quantilogram” model to check the directional predictability between the returns of the CBDCUI and CBDCAI indices
and that of eight cryptocurrencies and stablecoins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance, USD Coin, XRP, Terra and Dai. These digital
currencies are labelled in US dollars. We check for the directional predictability when the returns of the CBDC indices are in their lower
and higher quantiles, and when the returns of the cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are in nine quantiles: left (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2),
shoulder (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and right quantiles (0.8, 0.9 and 0.95). We used the continuously compounded returns in our analysis,
which are calculated using the first-difference in the logarithmic values of two consecutive prices.

Fig. 1 shows the “Portmonteau” statistic for the predictability from the CBDC uncertainty index towards digital currencies. Fig. 2
shows the cross-correlogram for the predictability from the CBDC uncertainty index towards cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.
However, Fig. 3 illustrates the “Portmonteau” statistic for the predictability from the CBDC attention index towards the cryptos. Fig. 4
shows the cross-correlogram for the predictability from the attention index towards virtual currencies. Then, Fig. 5 reports the evo­
lution of the cryptocurrency prices and indices.
We start our analysis by examining the case when the CBDC indices are in their low quantiles (0.1). The Portmonteau statistic
results show that the level of predictability is low and significant. Accordingly, overall, the behaviour of the cryptocurrencies and
stablecoins cannot be predicted from the behaviour of the CBDC indices. However, the findings show that there is no predictability
from the CBDC indices to cryptocurrencies.
The cross-correlogram results show that in some cases, the behaviour of cryptocurrencies in the next few days can be identified in
some intervals. Starting with the CBDC uncertainty index, the results show that when the CBDCUI is low, Bitcoin will earn good returns
over the next week when it is already low, as negative predictability is documented. Yet, when we move to the shoulders and the right
tail of Bitcoin, having good returns, the directional predictability becomes positive, suggesting that Bitcoin returns will decrease over
the next few days when the uncertainty index is low. These results are mostly insignificant. The most significant results are documented
in the 0.05 and 0.9 quantiles of digital currencies, suggesting that they become more sensitive to the CBDC uncertainty index when
their performance is at the highest and lowest, respectively, although the uncertainty index is at its lowest performance. The ‘crosscorrelogram’ results show that the overall pattern of the predictability from CBDC uncertainty index towards the rest of the crypto­
currencies included in the study is similar to the pattern documented for the relationship with Bitcoin. This result suggests that the
returns of cryptocurrencies are most sensitive to the CBDC uncertainty index when they are in their lowest or highest quantiles. When
the uncertainty is low, low cryptocurrency performance is likely to increase over the next few weeks and the good cryptocurrency
performance is likely to decrease during that time.
Our findings on the predictability from the CBDCAI in relation to the returns of the cryptocurrencies, when the CBDC is at its 0.1
quantile show again that the relationship between the index and cryptocurrencies is mostly significant when the virtual currencies are
at their lowest (0.05) and highest (0.95) quantiles. Starting with Bitcoin, the graphics report that when the CBDCAI is low, Bitcoin’s
performance is likely to increase over the next few weeks when it is already very low, as the relationship is shown to be negative. For

the rest of the quantiles, the relationship is mostly positive. This pattern is also detected for the relationship between the attention
index and Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD.
This relationship is explained by the fact that when the assets are in their highest (lowest) performance, investors would be
prompted to sell (buy) these assets massively to avoid losses (make profits). Consistent with the previous market events, these actions
could potentially lead to market crashes, thereby increasing investors’ fear about the occurrence of an unexpected market event.
Consequently, the relationship with the uncertainty index becomes significant even when the uncertainty is already low, as an extreme
asset performance normally raises uncertainty.
Regarding the rest of the cryptocurrencies, Tether, Binance, USD Coin and Dai, the graphs of the “Quantilogram” model show that
with a low performance of the CBDC index, the later cryptocurrencies are likely to have large losses when they are already low and to
earn large gains when they are already high in the coming weeks. This relationship is highest when the cryptocurrency returns are in
their left and right tails and more moderate in the shoulder quantile ranges. These findings suggest that these later cryptocurrencies
and stablecoins are expected to continue their original performance when the CBDCAI is low. This result indicates that these assets are
expected to maintain their original performance. In other words, when market participants ignore the evolution of an asset’s prices and
returns in the market, no selling or buying will occur, then these assets would not alter their behaviour. Consequently, the same pattern
of returns is maintained during the upcoming weeks.
We now focus on the relationship between the CBDC indices and the various cryptocurrencies when the indices have a high
performance, that is, when they are in the 0.9 quantile. Starting with the CBDC uncertainty index, the portmanteau statistics graphics
show that there is low and insignificant predictability from the returns of these indices when they are in the 0.9 quantile range.
Similarly for the predictability from the returns of the CBDCAI towards the returns of the cryptocurrencies. Despite the insignificant
relationship, the graphics are shown to be closer to the confidence boundary, suggesting that the relationship is more significant than
when the CBDC indices are in the 0.1 quantile range. Consequently, the behaviour of the various cryptocurrencies mentioned in this
study is not predictable from the behaviour of the CBDC indices.
Starting with Bitcoin, the cross-correlogram graphics show that in high uncertainty (the CBDCU index is at the 0.9 quantile), Bitcoin
is expected to realise small gains when they are in their lowest quantile, because the relationship is small and significant. For the rest of
the quantiles, the predictability becomes large and negative, suggesting that Bitcoin will face significant losses in the upcoming weeks;
however, this relationship is not significant. In the cryptocurrency’s uppermost quantile, although there are expected losses, they
become smaller than the rest of the quantiles. Turning to Ethereum, the ‘Cross-correlogram’ graphics show patterns similar to those of
12

Research in International Business and Finance 65 (2023) 101909

A. Ayadi et al.

Fig. 4. (continued).

Bitcoin. When the uncertainty is high, small significant gains are reported in the cryptocurrency’s lowest quantiles (0.05 and 0.1),
which turn to be larger losses for the rest of the quantiles. In the 0.95 quantile range, these losses become smaller in magnitude but
more clustering and significant. This pattern in also reported for Therra and XPR digital currencies. These findings are expected. When
uncertainty is high, the pattern of the traded assets would likely change. When these assets have low returns, the uncertainty of
whether these assets will maintain their low prices drives investors to trade more, which would eventually enhance the performance.
However, a high uncertainty, even when the assets have normal or high performance, would push market participants to try to get rid
of these assets, which would eventually inhibit these assets’ performance.
Considering the rest of cryptos (Tether, Binance, USD Coin and Dai), the ‘cross-correlogram’ graphics show that when uncertainty is
high, the cryptocurrencies show small gains, followed by large losses (when they are in their lowest quantiles) and small losses,
followed by larger gains (when they are already in their highest quantiles). As shown in Fig. 5, their prices are relatively less stable than
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Therra and XPR. Consequently, when uncertainty is high, it drives assets with low returns to realise small gains in
the upcoming weeks and those with very high performance to realise small losses over the course of the upcoming weeks. Nonetheless,
the uncertainty that drives market participants to engage in more trade eventually alters the performance of these assets, turning losses
into gains and vice versa.
Regarding the CBDCAI in relationship with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra, the ‘Cross-correlogram’ graphics show that greater
attention drives these assets to realise gains in the upcoming weeks (when they are in their lowest quantiles) and losses when they are
in their uppermost quantile. Although greater attention show that investors are interested in these assets, which explains the gains
realised in the upcoming weeks following an already low performance, too much attention to an already well-performing asset could
push investors to realise faster gains from these assets. thus, selling more of these assets, consequently, further increasing the prices.
For the rest of cryptocurrencies (Tether, Binance, USD Coin and Dai), high attention to the CBDC would sustain gains over the
upcoming weeks, while losses would transform into gains after a few weeks, because excess attention, along with price instability,
would alter a bad performance into a good performance.
4.2. Result discussion
Overall, the findings suggest that CBDC uncertainty index is negatively related to cryptocurrency and stablecoin returns, while the
CBDC attention index is negatively associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD and positively related to Tether, Binance,
USD Coin and Dai. In other words, the findings show that when the CBDC uncertainty index is low, Bitcoin have good returns in the

next few weeks if it is already low. Besides, Bitcoin will have low returns in the next few weeks if it is already high. These findings also
hold for the rest of the digital currencies.
Regarding the CBDCAI, our results suggest that when this index is low, the returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD are
likely to increase over the next few weeks when it is already very low. The performance of Tether, Binance, USD Coin and Dai may
decrease over the next few weeks when the attention index is low.
However, when the CBDC indices are in their upper quantiles, this indicates that Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD might
realise losses in the next few weeks when the CBDC uncertainty index is high and realise gains when the attention index is high. For
other stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, the results show small gains, followed by small losses when the CBDC uncertainty index is high
and that gains will persist over the next few weeks when the CBDC attention index is high, while losses would be transformed into
gains.
Overall, our findings indicate that the future performance of the selected digital currencies goes in the opposite direction of un­
certainty. These results suggest that Bitcoin, including other virtual currencies, maintain their hedging characteristics in periods of
distress and uncertainty (Yen and Cheng, 2021; Colon et al., 2021). In fact, when there is low market uncertainty, the returns of the
digital currencies might increase in the upcoming weeks. This could be explained by the fact that investors are certain about the
market, thus they will choose their strategies to make gains. Moreover, when the uncertainty is high, investors are unsure about the
market occurrence, which would increase the possibility that losses would be made in the upcoming weeks as these strategies might
not suite the event that may occur during the upcoming period.
These conclusions confirm the findings of Colon et al. (2021), who documented that despite the heterogeneous reactions of
cryptocurrencies depending on the type of uncertainty, these assets could be a strong hedger against geopolitical risks in most cases but
it could be considered a weak hedge against economic policy uncertainty during of bullish market behaviour. Moreover, Wu et al.
(2021) found that economic policy uncertainty positively affects four cryptocurrency returns (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple).
That is, these returns increase with cryptocurrencies and vice versa. This confirms our results as we check for the predicted behaviour
of the cryptocurrencies (cryptocurrencies will increase later when the uncertainty is now low and vice versa). Yen and Cheng (2021)
found that Chinese economic policy uncertainty is negatively associated with Bitcoin and Litecoin future volatility, which implies that
these assets could make a good hedging tool against the economic policy uncertainty risk. This also aligns with Haq, Inzamam Ul, et al.
(2021), who documented that cryptocurrencies have heterogeneous connectedness patterns with the economic policy uncertainty;
thus, the risk mitigation ability varies from country to country. According to the authors, this is explained by the dependence of

economic policy uncertainty to the policies and decisions usually made by regulatory authorities of a particular country.
Regarding the attention index, low attention towards cryptocurrencies means that their current performance is also low. Conse­
quently, an increase in the performance is expected in the future, thus increasing attention. However, high attention means that the
cryptocurrency performance is good, thus a future decline is expected.
Our results align the findings of Smales (2022), who documented that increase in investor attention is associated with higher
returns, more volatility and greater illiquidity in cryptocurrency markets. Li et al. (2021) found that investor attention has a relatively
stronger impact on the cryptocurrency returns in bearish markets than that in bullish markets in the short term. Subramaniam and
Chakraborty (2020) documented that investors focus on the frequently news and ranked cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum),
while the attention towards newer cryptocurrencies such as Rippl, influences their prices only during superior performance. Gurdgiev
and O’Loughlina (2020) showed that investor sentiment can predict the price direction of cryptocurrencies.
5. Conclusion
This study attempts to examine the predictability of the returns of several cryptocurrencies and stablecoins (Bitcoin, Ethereum,
Tether, Binance, USD Coin, XRP, Terra and Dai) based on two CBDC indices (the CBDC uncertainty index and the CBDC attention
index). To do so, we used the “Quantilogram” model introduced by Han et al. (2016). The main advantage of this methodology is that
the degree of predictability can be measured in different quantiles of distributions. The findings show that when the CBDC uncertainty
index is low, Bitcoin will have good returns in the next few weeks when it is already low. Besides, Bitcoin will have low returns in the
next few weeks when it is already high. These findings also hold for the rest of the digital currencies. Regarding the CBDC attention
index, our results suggest that when this index is low, the returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD may increase over the next
few weeks when it is already very low. Regarding Tether, Binance, USD Coin and Dai, their performance is expected to decrease over
the next weeks when the attention index is low. However, when the CBDC indices are in their upper quantiles, the findings suggest that
Bitcoin, Ethereum, XPR and Terra USD are may incur losses in the next few weeks when the CBDC uncertainty index is high and earns
gains when the attention index is high. For the other stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, the results show small gains, followed by small
losses when the CBDC uncertainty index is high and that the gains will persist over the next few weeks when the CBDC attention index
is high, while losses would be transformed into gains.
These findings could be useful for investors, regulators and policy makers as they provide insight of the future behaviour of the top
cryptocurrencies and stablecoins when a shock occurs in the CBDC market, which would guide them towards appropriate choices
