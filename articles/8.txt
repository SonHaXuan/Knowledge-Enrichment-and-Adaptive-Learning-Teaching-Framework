ABSTRACT
Nowadays, more and more banks and other financial service companies are promoting digital currency transfers and
other online transactions, which are wire transfers or transfers between parties over long distances. Digital currency
contributes to the globalization of the global economy because it is easier to trade by sending and receiving digital
currency. [1] The Technology underlying Money continues to evolve, and many scholars and experts are concerned
about the development of the digital currency. Through the research of domestic and foreign digital currency literature
and related information, this article summarizes the concept, classification, characteristics and benefits, risks and
potential problems of digital currency, and finally gives an overview of the development trend of digital currency. In a
broad sense, digital currency is any form of money or payment that exists only in spreadsheets. And digital currency
could be classified as cryptocurrency, virtual currency and central bank digital currency(CBDC). They are usually
decentralized and anonymous. The features enhance the security of users. Digital currencies offer enhanced security,
greater convenience and compatibility, making up for the drawbacks of cash. Market risks, security risks, law risks,
bank risks and risks for producers are the main risks that digital currency brings. According to much research, CBDCs
which can maximum to limit the risks of digital currency might be the main trends of digital currency’s future.

Keywords: digital currency, cryptocurrencies, CBDCs, decentralization, regulation

1. INTRODUCTION
There are subtle differences between digital
currencies and cryptocurrencies, although the two terms
are often used interchangeably. Cryptocurrency is a
subset of digital currency, but it uses cryptography to
ensure security, so this makes counterfeiting extremely
difficult [24].The 2008 global financial crisis
accelerated the inevitable evolution of currencies into
cryptocurrencies. Blockchain, distributed ledger and
decentralization are innovations of this currency
revolution. The emergence of cryptocurrency has made
up for the shortcomings of the original real currency,
while also bringing other benefits and potential risks.
However, many countries can only take wait-and-see or
even ban measures because of the risks brought by its
characteristics. What will be the future of digital
currency has become a concern of many economists and
national governments. This paper summarizes the
current situation, classification, characteristics and
possible benefits and risks of digital currency published
by previous scholars, and puts forward suggestions on
supervision. And the future development direction of
digital currency is predicted.

2. DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT
SITUATION
After the price of bitcoin exceeded $10000, digital
currencies are receiving increasing traction every day.
According to the white paper of bitcoin, bitcoin is a
purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that will
allow online payments to be sent directly from one
party to the other without going through a third-party
intermediary. The appearance of bitcoin is revolutionary
for commercial currency. Several representative digital
currencies after bitcoin include Libra, DCEP, etc. Libra
is another type of digital currency and cryptocurrency
which is created by Facebook.[1]
While there are many concerned that bitcoin’s price
is over-hyped, the blockchain --- the technology behind
digital currency, is used by many countries to try to
create their digital currencies, such as Sweden, Tunisia,
Ecuador, Japan and Russia, etc. And DCEP is a
particular digital currency and cryptocurrency created
by the Chinese central bank with Blockchain and
Cryptographic technology.[2]

As of August 14, 2020, the Ministry of Commerce
has officially issued the "Comprehensive Deepening of
Service Trade Innovation and Development Pilot
Program" to carry out DCEP pilot projects in the
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei,
Yangtze
River
Delta,
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and
the pilot areas in the central and western regions where
conditions permit. However, although China promotes
their own CBDCs, DCEP, China banned all
cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies trading and
speculation. All business activities related to
cryptocurrency are illegal financial activities and firmly
forbid.[22] In addition to China's official national-level
digital currency issuance, international regulatory
attitudes towards digital currencies are mainly divided
into three categories. The first is the appropriate type of
regulation, such as the United States. Several state
governments have proposed and passed laws affecting
cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, and most of
these activities take place in the legislative branch.
There are generally two methods of supervision at the
state level. Some states try to promote the technology
through very favorable regulations so that
cryptocurrencies are not subject to state securities laws
and/or currency transmission regulations. These
countries hope to use investment in technology to
stimulate the local economy and improve public
services.[19] The second is the type of active support,
such as Thailand. In 2018, Thailand issued the "digital
asset law", but it was revised in 2021. As of February
15, 2021, the Ministry of Finance has issued 14 licenses
to 11 operators. The Office of the US Securities and
Exchange Commission announced a list of 7
cryptocurrencies that are allowed to be used for ICO
investment and trading as well as basic trading pairs.
They are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum
Classic, Litecoin, Ripple and Stellar.[20]The third type
is completely prohibited, such as in Bangladesh and
Nepal. The countries ban all cryptocurrencies.[21]

3. CLASSIFICATION OF DIGITAL
CURRENCY
Usually, digital currencies are divided into three
categories:

3.1. Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses
encryption technology to protect and verify online
transactions. Cryptography is also used to manage and
control the creation of such currencies. Bitcoin is one

example of cryptocurrency. Depending on the
jurisdiction, cryptocurrencies might or might not be
regulated.[6]

3.2. Virtual Currency
Virtual currency is an unregulated digital currency
that is controlled by a developing agent or a founding
organization made up of various stakeholders involved
in the process. Virtual currency can also be
algorithmically controlled through defined network
protocols. An example of virtual currency is gaming
network tokens, the economics of which are defined and
controlled by developers. [6]

3.3. Central Bank Digital Currency(CBDC)
The Bank of England describes CBDC as an
electronic CB currency( where CB is the central bank):
(i) Can be accessed more widely than reserves,
(ii) The potential function of retail transactions is
much greater than cash,
(iii) Having a different operating structure from
other forms of central bank currency, making it possible
to serve different core purposes, and
(iv) It can be interest-bearing. Under realistic
assumptions, the interest rate paid is different from the
reserve interest rate.[7] And, Digital Currency
Electronic Payment(DCEP), the digital currency created
by China is one example of CBDC.

4. FEATURES OF DIGITAL CURRENCY
It is undeniable that there are similarities and
differences among the three different digital currencies
of cryptocurrency, virtual currency and CBDC, but they
all have the following characteristics of digital
currencies.

4.1. Decentralization
So far, although there is no complete consensus on
the characteristics of digital currencies, most currencies
and economists believe that ‘decentralization’ is one of
its most important and obvious characteristics. In
Satoshi Nakamoto’s perspective, the concept behind
Bitcoin, is a decentralized consensus, with no need for a
central intermediary.[3]
The decentralized commerce can usually be defined
as the exchange of financial instruments, goods and

586

Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 648

services on a global scale through emerging
decentralized technologies. Starting from various
experiments of electronic cash, such as DigiCash,
including the emergence of the Bitcoin protocol in 2009,
the digital asset market is a market for virtual asset
investment opportunities. [4] Whether it is bitcoin, libra
or DCEP, these digital currencies and cryptocurrencies
all have the characteristics of decentralization.

Another feature is anonymity. Distributed ledger
technology(DLT) which is the basis of digital
currencies is designed either on an anonymous basis. To
restrict the number of money users can spend on
AML/CTF without viewing transaction data by the
AML authority, a new concept-"anonymous
credentials" was designed. The AML authority
periodically sends out these additional, time-limited
statuses to each central bank digital currency(CBDC)
user. If users want to transfer CBDC without disclosing
information to the AML authority, they need to spend
these vouchers to transfer in. Therefore, the number of
CBDCs that can be used anonymously is limited by the
number of vouchers provided to each user by the AML
agency. Although technically speaking, vouchers are
"spent", they are just a technical tool used to limit the
amount of CBDC that can be transferred
anonymously.[5]

transmissions can be enforced without recording the
amount of CBDC spent by users, thereby protecting
users' privacy[5], security, which is the advantage of the
anonymity of digital currency. Additionally, digital
currency, DCEP as the example, compared to traditional
crash is more convenient. The DCEP can be paid
through a payment institution or not through a payment
institution, bank account circulation. Furthermore, the
good compatibility of the CBDC allows it to be used in
many scenarios, regardless of the system and network
used in the scenario. Generally speaking, in the
scenarios where cash, electronic money and bank
deposits can be paid, CBDC can also make payments.
Also, the CBDC can make up for the shortcomings of
cash. The research also proves that cash has the
following drawbacks due to its characteristics: a. the
cost of issuance, storage and processing of cash is
relatively high; b. cash is often used for illegal
economic activities due to its complete anonymity; c.
cash will make it impossible to implement a negative
interest rate monetary policy. If the CBDC is
implemented, then it will well solve the
above-mentioned shortcoming of cash. The issuance of
the CBDC is based on system generation, which will
greatly reduce the cost of issuance and storage. In
addition, due to the controllable anonymity of the
CBDC, relevant illegal and criminal activities can be
well traced through the system’s records when illegal
economic behavior occurs.[9]

5. BENEFITS OF DIGITAL CURRENCY

6. RISKS OF DIGITAL CURRENCY

Decentralization brings benefits to digital currency
compared to real money. For example, Coming from
computer science rather than economics or business, the
core innovation is to use encrypted certificates instead
of trusted third parties to verify the integrity of
transaction information in a decentralized computer
network. Bitcoin does not eliminate trust. It can be said
that it provides automation of trust through blockchain
and distributed ledger technology (DLT). In short,
algorithms record transactions in blocks and add them
to the existing blockchain through cryptographic
signatures. This "blockchain" represents a transaction
ledger in which a hash function maps keys of variable
size to values of fixed size. In a "distributed" ledger,
new blocks must be verified by all participants or
groups of permitted participants ("nodes") that
synchronize and maintain the entire transaction history.
Generate multiple copies of the same ledger, thereby
enhancing the security of the system.[8] Anonymity
means that restrictions on anonymous CBDC

However, due to the decentralization of digital
currency, anonymity and price instability have led to
many side effects and risks. It is not difficult to find the
following risks which lead to digital currency has not
been fully popular after being integrated Agustin
Carstens(2021), Pasuthip, P., & Yang, S. (2020), and
Cristian deRitis(2021).

4.2. Anonymity

6.1. Market Risks
The digital currency price is unstable. In practice,
bitcoin is more like a speculative asset rather than
money. Bitcoin seems very charming but lacks real
value. The Bitcoin network might be considered as an
online gamers community that uses real money
exchange items that only exist in network zones.
Bitcoin calls itself a unit of account. In fact, the
decentralization makes the value of Bitcoin fluctuate
means that it is not realistic to set a stable price for
Bitcoin. This also weakens its usefulness as a means of

587

Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 648

exchange and makes it have a poor ability to store
value.[2] The price manipulation: The Bitcoin market’s
structure is decidedly concentrated and non-transparent,
and it has been proved that price manipulation exists in
the Bitcoin market. [3]Besides, the features make the
price of digital currency is unstable and not easy for
consumers to accept digital currency.

be aware that not all managers are equal and
cryptocurrencies in different countries often have
multiple diverse and differing regulatory frameworks.
The best outcome would be regulatory confirmation
from all agencies, but given the vested interests of each
regulator, approval from at least two should be enough
to increase credibility and trust.[23]

6.2. Security Risks

7.2. Foreign Exchange Reserve Requirements

Digital currency is still the choice of black market
trading medium to this day; digital currencies are easily
chosen by criminal organizations and terrorist groups to
process funds.[11] Therefore, the concealment of digital
currency has brought hidden dangers to the security of
economic property and social stability.

Enhancements to the ecosystem could include more
robust cryptocurrency exchanges, organizations that
help interesting individuals trade in the traditional sense.
Cryptocurrency exchanges that not only act as an
exchange but also act as brokers and custodians. If these
exchanges hold a certain amount of reserves to weather
any major downturn or crash, using the same principles
as clearinghouses, this would add an additional layer of
protection during periods of volatility and market
uncertainty.[23]

Law risks: It is not easy for law enforcement to
target one particular central entity or location to
investigate or seize assets[11]; blockchains afford
money is kept outside of banks which makes law
enforcement is not promoted. The beneficiaries may be
anonymous, the transaction flow may be confused, and
income may be hidden for tax purposes.[13]
Bank risks: some people are concerned that
increasing CBDCA sorts of digital currency will raise
the risk of structural disintermediation of banks for the
global banking system and the risk of promoting a
systemic run on the bank in a critical situation.[10]
Risks for producers: As depositors seek safer
alternatives, they face the risk of a run during times of
stress[12];
From the above content, it can be seen that the
decentralization, anonymity and other characteristics of
digital currency, as well as it is not a fully mature
technology, have caused it to have greater risks in the
market, legislation, and supervision.

7. REGULATIONS & SUGGESTIONS
There are mainly 5 risk management measurements
in the risks of digital currencies.

7.1. Regulatory Approval
The most important inherent risk mitigation
associated with cryptocurrencies is regulatory approval.
Some regulatory approvals, if obtained, could enhance
and imply acceptance and credibility in the
cryptocurrency community. To do this, the best place to
start must be the reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, but

7.3. Risk Management Framework
The significance of risk documentation cannot be
overstated because there is a consensus among
ecosystems involved in risk management guidelines,
standards, and procedures that align themselves with
good industry best practices. A standard risk
management framework will cover standards and
procedures for cyber, fraud, business credit, entity
secure assets, IT security and data, third-party vendors,
and anti-money laundering, which will require business
continuity and disaster recovery plan. Because all of
these risks are highly correlated, the framework needs
to be a broad enterprise. To be effective and actionable,
the risk framework needs to be complemented by a
great deal of content through real-time information
gathering and scenario planning. Given the great
dependence on technological change and development,
software upgrades need special mention and attention.
More importantly, each participant in the ecosystem
chain should take risks, assess the adequacy and
effectiveness of the implementation of its
documentation, in order to aid confidence and reduce
risks. The application of common standards such as
CCSS(Cryptocurrency Security Standard) introduced in
2014 should be supported by all. (This standard is
currently the standard for any information system that
handles and manages crypto wallets as part of its
business.[23]

588

7.4. Education
Those overseeing mergers and acquisitions need to
understand the legal and operational risks of
cryptocurrency and blockchain. In order to provide
adequate protection in the statement and warranties
documents of the transaction[23].

7.5. Law-created
Digital currency transactions are governed by
common law, including contract law, but are also
governed by the principles of negligence, agency, and
fairness, such as fiduciary relationships. Regulatory
actions vary around the world, from making digital
currencies unregulated to taking some actions in
taxation, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism
financing, to complete bans. For example, the People's
Bank of China has banned fundraising through digital
currency issuance,[14] South Korean authorities have
also done so. [15] The European Securities and Markets
Authority and the US Securities and Exchange
Commission have reminded investors of the high risks
of ICOs. [16] The ban will inevitably put downward
pressure on prices. In the middle area, there are already
some regulatory warnings about risks. Some securities
regulators have stated that although digital currencies
provide new opportunities for companies to raise funds
and investors to gain wider investment. At the same
time, they can rise protection concerns of investors.[17]
The characteristics of digital currency and the risks it
brings make it necessary to supervise digital currency.

8. FUTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
In fact, it is hard to make an accurate prediction
about the future of digital currency development. In
Tony Richards’ opinion, some form of intermediaries
will still be a vitally important role, even the world
finance is more decentralization than the current
situation[18]. And there are two aspects of the choice of
payment instrument which will be used to settle the
transactions. The first is that entities and individuals are
likely to want to pay and receive financial assets with a
high degree of value stability. Very few parties to
transactions, especially high-value parties, hope to settle
by paying in a cryptocurrency with high volatility. Fiat
currencies, such as CBDCs or very safe stable coins that
are issued by regulatory entities, will be widely used in
tokenized asset transactions. In the second, he
anticipates that entities that conduct transactions on the
blockchain will want to ensure that they can conduct

transactions in a clear and final settlement. He also
envisioned a future where the establishment of a strong
regulatory framework for stable coins may lead to the
issuance of stable coins by highly rated entities.[18]
There is a high percentage probability which the
increasing Central banks may switch to issuing CBDCs.

9. CONCLUSION
This paper summarizes a large number of pieces of
literature and finds that the development of digital
currency and blockchain technology can make up for
cash drawbacks, realize automation, improve
compatibility and reduce release costs. Due to its
imperfect technology, market risks, security risks, law
risks, banks risks and risks for producers, governments
around the world are adopting different ways to
strengthen regulation of cryptocurrency represented by
bitcoin. Regulatory approaches include regulatory
approval, foreign exchange reserve requirements, risk
management framework, education and strengthening
legal supervision. At the same time, countries plan or
attempt to issue national digital currencies (CBDCs)
issued by central banks, centering on decentralization.
The launch of CBDC seems to be the main development
trend of digital currency in the future.
