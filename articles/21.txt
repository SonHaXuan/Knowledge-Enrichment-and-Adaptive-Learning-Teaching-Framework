Based on coverage of over 660m news stories from LexisNexis News & Business between 2015–2021, we provide
two new indices around the growing area of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): the CBDC Uncertainty Index
(CBDCUI) and CBDC Attention Index (CBDCAI). We show that both indices spiked during news related to new
developments in CBDC and in relation to digital currency news items. We demonstrate that CBDC indices have a
significant negative relationship with the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE AllWorld Index, and positive with the volatilities of cryptocurrency markets, foreign exchange markets, bond
markets, VIX, and gold. Our results suggest that financial markets are more sensitive to CBDC Uncertainty than
CBDC Attention as proxy by these indices. These findings contain useful insights to individual and institutional
investors, and can guide policymakers, regulators, and the media on how CBDC evolved as a barometer in the
new digital-currency era.

1. Introduction
While our times are certainly changing, let us hope money remains
with us. As a medium of exchange, money has evolved from shells, dogs
teeth, knotted fabric, precious metals, banker’s notes, cash to crypto­
currency (Davies, 2010). While cryptocurrency is still a largely unreg­
ulated area, the introduction of the Central Bank Digital Currencies
(CBDCs) will manifest the beginning of a new monetary era (Laboure
et al., 2021). Now, the Bahamas has already implemented CBDC in its
territory, and China has recently completed two CBDC tests. The CBDC
wallet app is now available in Suzhou, Xiongan, Shenzhen, and
Chengdu, and the People’s Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority has begun ’technical testing’ for cross-border use of e-CNY.
Uruguay has also completed a CBDC pilot test. CBDC is a virtual form of
a country’s fiat currency issued by the central bank (Yao, 2018b). CBDC
was initially called a Digital Fiat Currency (DFC) (Krylov et al., 2018),

which draws inspiration from famous crypto assets such as Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Binance Coin, among others. In 2013, Shoaib et al. (2013)
introduced the alternative terms of Official Digital Currency (ODC) and
the Official Digital Currency System (ODCS).
A CBDC is of great importance over conventional cryptocurrencies
and fiat currencies when studying. First, from the perspective of pay­
ment, it saves costs, prevents counterfeiting, and strengthens the au­
thority of legal tender while enhancing the inclusive character of the
payment system (Sun et al., 2017). It also optimises the payment func­
tion of legal tender, reducing the reliance on payment services on
business banks and private sectors, thereby decreasing the burden and
pressure of supervision on the central bank (Qian, 2019). Second, CBDCs
can benefit to the monetary supervision and regulation. The structured
currency circulation data allows total amount of money supply to be
regulated precisely [Agarwal et al., 2021; Fernández-Villaverde et al.,
2021]. This ameliorates the dilemmas facing modern monetary policies,

such as inefficient policy transmissions, difficult regulation of conver­
sion periods, the flow of money from the real economy to the virtual one,
and the failed realisation of expected requirements by monetary pol­
icies. Moreover, capital flow information can be fully and quickly
investigated, thereby aiding anti-corruption, anti-money laundering,
anti-terrorist financing, and anti-tax evasion efforts [Tronnier, 2021;
Dupuis et al., 2021]. Third, CBDCs have the potential to promote
financial market stability by adjusting monetary, mitigating financial
systemic risk, reducing shadow banking, among others [Larina and
Akimov, 2020; Copeland, 2020; Zams et al., 2020].
While a CBDC could provide some benefits, it may also bring several
significant challenges for society. First, CBDCs could exacerbate finan­
cial uncertainty during periods of economic stress [Ferrari et al., 2022;
Sinelnikova-Muryleva, 2020]. Without effective regulations, individuals
can hold CBDCs indefinitely. Therefore, in the event of a crisis, in­
dividuals or economic agents could try to substitute CBDCs for bank
deposits, as they may be perceived as less risky (Williamson, 2021). This
behaviour may lead to bank runs and financial instability. Second,
similar to the first point, CBDCs could have negative consequences for
financial intermediation, aka the banking sector. Banks play an impor­
tant role in deposit management and payments. Now, some FinTech
payment platforms have emerged that only focus on one function of
money: payments. Meanwhile, other financial services are organised
around the payment function, including features such as credit, fund
management, and insurance (good examples of this kind of platform are
Alipay and WeChat Wallet). These FinTech payment platforms connect
consumers (borrowers, debtors, investors, among others) together,
rather than the banks, so that banks can be replaced. CBDCs could have
the same characteristic as these FinTech payment platforms because
they also allow the general public easy access the central bank balance
sheet. Therefore, some scholars worry that digital currency and digi­
talisation could cause an inversion of the currency financial intermedi­
ation system [Tronnier et al., 2020; Meaning et al., 2021]. Although
Brunnermeier and Landau (2022) argue that CBDCs would only have
small negative effects on the financial intermediation system because of
the low circulation volume, the real effects of CBDCs on the banks
business model could only be proved with the development of CBDCs
and would also vary depending on their liquidity. Third, CBDCs could
pose risks to individual privacy [Fu et al., 2019; Tronnier, 2021]. The
original intention of the CBDC design tries to strike a balance between
the ’controllable anonymity’ and ’anti-money laundering’ (Turrin,
2021). Therefore, CBDCs do not allow for anonymous transactions in the
same way that cash can be spent anonymously (Lee et al., 2021c). Data
privacy regulations could provide some protections, but these may be
insufficient to eliminate public concerns over the risk of state surveil­
lance (Borgonovo et al., 2021). Fourth, as a kind of digital currency,
CBDCs could bring about environmental issues (Laboure et al., 2021).
The production, deposit and transaction of CBDCs would likely consume
a plethora of energy and emit a large amount of CO2 , leaving carbon
footprints and causing increased environmental pollution. Finally,
CBDCs could trigger a new round of trade wars between China and the
United States [Waller, 2021; Goldman, 2022]. The Society for World­
wide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system gives the
United States a strong economic sanction capability. However, the dig­
ital renminbi supported by China’s Cross-Border International Payments
Systems (CIPS) can replace SWIFT and challenge the existing interna­
tional payments system, which is dominated by the United Stated
(Goldman, 2022). This potential threat could trigger U.S. sanctions on
Chinese banks by pressuring their transaction nodes, leading to a
renewed U.S.-China trade war.
CBDCs’ encouraging progress has generated extensive attention and
discussions among academics and economists. The majority of available
studies still concentrate on the fundamental qualitative analysis of CBDC
and its technological innovations. The latest CBDC studies can be clas­
sified into five sub-groups. The first discusses (among other aspects) the
definition, characteristics, classification, main models, and implications

of the CBDC variants, as well as the potential advantages and risks of its
introduction [Cunha et al., 2021; Kochergin, 2021]. The second focuses
on the design theory, technology innovation, and model optimisation of
CBDC [Qian, 2019; Lee et al., 2021b]. The third examines its security
and privacy [Borgonovo et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021c]. The fourth an­
alyses CBDC’s impacts on the monetary system and monetary policy
[Davoodalhosseini, 2021; Meaning et al., 2021]. The fifth group in­
vestigates the relationships between CBDC and banking, including
commercial and central banking [Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2021;
Williamson, 2021]. Whereas only few studies investigate how current
CBDCs’ discussion among regulators and in the media affect behaviour
of financial markets. Considering the process of CBDCs is at the early
stages of development and adoption there is the lack of data or proxies
which can reflect and stand for the CBDCs, thus hindering quantitative
analyses of CBDC’s effects on financial markets.
To fill this research gap and conduct a quantitative analysis of CBDC
with financial markets, we developed and made available two CBDC
indices the CBDC Uncertainty (CBDCUI) and the CBDC Attention
(CBDCAI), that can be used to track CBDCs’ trends and variations. Our
data covers the main period of CBDC development and the period of the
most active discussion of this new asset in the media, i.e. from January
2015 to June 2021. Thus, we construct our indices use 663,881,640
news items collected from Lexis-Nexis News & Business. In this paper,
we first to empirically examine the impact of CBDC news on the financial
markets. Our sample includes the main cryptocurrency uncertainty
indices, which are Cryptocurrency Policy Uncertainty Index (UCRY
Policy or UCRYPo), Cryptocurrency Price Uncertainty Index (UCRY
Price or UCRYPr), Cryptocurrency Environmental Attention Index
(ICEA); Bitcoin as a proxy of cryptocurrency markets; the MSCI World
Banks Index (MSCI WBI) and the FTSE World Government Bond Index
(FTSE WGBI) to represent the commercial banking sectors, and the bond
markets, separately. Furthermore, we selected EUR/USD, GBP/USD,
RUB/USD, JPY/USD, and CNY/USD to represent the foreign exchange
markets. To account for economic price and policy uncertainty we also
included the The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) and the United States
Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (USEPU) in our sample. Finally, we
chose the FTSE All-World Index (FTSE AWI) to represent the stock
markets and gold as a safe-haven assets that often has been compared
with Bitcoin.
We begin our empirical analysis with a vector autoregression (VAR)
for testing the effectiveness and validity of the newly issued indices.
Then, we apply a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to
process a structural shock analysis of the effects of CBDCUI and CBDCAI
on indices, as well as macro-level variables using impulse response
function (IRF), forecast errors variance decomposition (FEVD), and
historical decomposition (HD) tests. We further employ the dynamic
conditional correlation (DCC-GJR-GARCH) model to investigate in­
terconnections between indices and financial variables. Applications of
SVAR and DCC-GJR-GARCH models to our set of variables, helps us to
uncover how CBDC indices interact with these financial indicators
providing novel empirical evidence on the CBDC news on financial
markets.
This paper contributes to the existing literature in three main ways.
First, based on news coverage from LexisNexis News & Business, we
developed two new indices for CBDC between 2015–2021: the CBDCUI
and CBDCAI, that can be used by investors, policy makers and financial
regulators to monitor the impact of CBDC-related discussions on vola­
tility of financial markets. Our indices capture CBDC trends and un­
certainties as they are able to react to major relevant events. For
example, our indices spiked near new CBDC announcements, digital
currency flash-news, and main policy debates. Second, the paper reports
that CBDCUI and CBDCAI indices had a significantly negative effect on
the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and FTSE AllWorld Index, where the volatilities of the financial variables reacted
more strongly to shocks transmitted from the CBDCUI. Third, the paper
presents the historical decomposition results, that show that the
2

cumulative positive and negative effects of CBDCUI disturbances tend to
be larger than those of the CBDCAI on the financial variables. Positive
news items and government policy announcements can have a signifi­
cant negative affect on the CBDCUI historical decomposition results, i.e.
decreasing the uncertainty around CBDC introduction. Besides, we show
that both CBDCUI and CBDCAI historical decomposition results signifi­
cantly spiked near key CBDC progress news and significant events
regarding digital currency.
Our paper offers useful proxies of CBDCs uncertainty and attention
and a novel evidence for future quantitative studies into CBDCs. More­
over, this paper successfully links CBDCs to the financial markets and
other volatility and uncertainty measures, that can originate another
strand of CBDCs literature. The results provide novel useful insights for
investors, policymakers, regulators, and media on how CBDCs evolved
as a barometer in the new digital-currency era. For example, policy­
makers and regulators can adjust fiscal policy by referencing our CBDC
indices. And the CBDC indices can guide investors to increase or reduce
their financial assets’ net long positions.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 out­
lines previous CBDCs literature. Section 3 describes the construction of
the indices and the data for the empirical analysis, while Section 4 de­
scribes the econometric methods used. Section 5 presents the empirical
results and robustness tests. Finally, Section 6 discussed the main find­
ings of this research and its implications.

beyond the real economy. Wagner et al. (2021) discussed and proposed a
potential blueprint for a digital euro and proved its possibility. Lee et al.
(2021b) proposed a blockchain-based settlement system using
cross-chain atomic swaps that could be implemented for the CBDCs to
manage settlement risks.
The third group illustrates CBDCs’ security and privacy. Fu et al.
(2019), Tronnier (2021) and Borgonovo et al. (2021) demonstrated the
significance of anonymity for increasing the overall attraction of CBDCs’
social medium payment. Lee et al. (2021c) conducted a survey on se­
curity and privacy in blockchain-based CBDCs to address the remaining
security and privacy research gaps, and a techno-legal taxonomy of
methodologies was further proposed to balance CBDCs privacy and
transparency without impeding accountability (Pocher and Veneris,
2021).
The fourth group analyses the impacts of CBDCs on monetary sys­
tems and policy. For instance, using a literature review, Tronnier et al.
(2020) systematically revised CBDCs and further discussed their impli­
cations on economics, monetary policy, and legal issues. Meaning et al.
(2021) discussed CBDCs’ potential impact on monetary transmission
mechanisms, and found that monetary policy can operate as it does now
by adjusting the price or quantity of CBDCs. Shen and Hou (2021)
applied a qualitative analysis of China’s CBDCs and their impacts on
monetary policy and payment competition, and argued that CBDCs have
potential to transform the field completely rather than be a mere regu­
latory toolkit, especially when CBDCs will be adopted at a large-scale. To
put it simply, some scholars hold positive views towards CBDCs on
monetary policy. They have argued that CBDCs are useful complements
to monetary and reserve policy (Davoodalhosseini, 2021), and that they
have the potential power to strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism and bear interest (Stevens, 2021). However, other studies
have discussed CBDCs’ monetary risks, for example, Viuela et al. (2020)
listed the sources of these risks, and presented both solutions and sug­
gestions for further CBDCs research.
The fifth group investigates the relationships between CBDCs and
banking, including commercial and central banking. Cukierman (2020)
provided two proposals CBDCs’ implementation, i.e the moderate and
radical. The former suggests that only the banking sector can have access
to deposits at central banks, while the latter suggests that the whole
private sector could hold digital currency deposits at central banks.
Cukierman supported the radical proposal due to its ability to condense
the banking system and reduce the need for deposit insurance.
Furthermore, some discussions have centred around the new role of
central banks in the digital currency era. Some scholars believe that
CBDCs can upset commercial banking because central banks are more
stable and can play an essential role in reducing risks in economic
transactions [Yamaoka, 2019; Zams et al., 2020; Sinelnikova-Muryleva,
2020]. This could possibly even lead to commercial banking panic
(Williamson, 2021) or allow central banks to become deposit monopo­
lists (Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2021).
None of these studies have linked CBDCs to financial markets. One
possible reason for this research gap is the lack of a time series proxy that
relates to the CBDCs. However, several scholars have shown that an
index of news coverage frequency can serve as a proxy to reflect the
uncertainty of one economic or financial objective (e.g., economic pol­
icy, cryptocurrency policy, or cryptocurrency price) [Baker et al., 2016,
Huang and Luk, 2020; Lucey et al., 2021], or draw public attention to an
economic or financial objective (e.g., cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency
environmental, P2P lending) [He et al., 2021; Smales, 2022; Wang et al.,
2022]. These papers further confirm that the uncertainty or attention
indices mentioned above can act as validity and efficiency proxies by
investigating their impacts on micro or macroeconomic variables. This
research gap is the motivation behind our work to uncover the effects of
CBDC news on financial markets. This is achieved by introducing new
CBDC indices to capture existing trends and reflect the variations of
CBDC uncertainty and attention by gathering a large amount of CBDC
news items and analysing the interconnections between the CBDC

2. Literature review
A CBDC is a government credit-based digital currency, thereby
reducing their risks. Therefore, some economic agents and individuals
might prefer to transfer money from commercial banks to CBDCs during
financial crises (Sinelnikova-Muryleva, 2020). Many regulators and re­
searchers regard a CBDC as a nationally issued ’tablecoin’, and believe it
can balance the banking system (Sissoko, 2020) and positively impacts
financial stability [Larina and Akimov, 2020; Copeland, 2020;
McLaughlin, 2021; Buckley et al., 2021]. Indeed, Zams et al. (2020),
using an analytic network process and the Delphi method, demonstrated
that the cash-like CBDCs model is the most suitable CBDCs design for
Indonesia because it can improve financial inclusion and reduce shadow
banking. Tong and Jiayou (2021) investigated the effects of the issuance
of digital currency/electronic payment on economics based on a
four-sector DSGE model, and conclude that CBDCs can mitigate the
leverage ratio and the systemic financial risk. Barrdear and Kumhof
(2021) examined the macroeconomic consequences of launching CBDCs
by a DSGE model, and found that CBDCs issuance 30%’s GDP, against
government bonds, could be permanently raised by 3%. Additionally,
Fantacci and Gobbi (2021) focused on the geopolitical, strategic, and
military impacts of CBDCs.
However, CBDCs are new research fields within digital currency and
fintech domain, and a few paper available to date can be roughly allo­
cated into five main sub-groups.
The first group discusses, among other aspects, the definition, char­
acteristics, classification, main models, and implications of the CBDCs
variants, and the potential advantages and risks of its introduction [Yao,
2018b; Masciandaro, 2018; Cunha et al., 2021; Kochergin, 2021; Li and
Huang, 2021; Allen et al., 2022]. While the above mentioned re­
searchers hold positive attitudes towards CBDCs, Kirkby (2018) criti­
cised CBDCs as they would increase the central bank’s costs for the
whole money supply system.
The second group of studies focuses on the CBDCs’ design theory,
technological innovation, and model optimisation. Sun et al. (2017)
proposed a multi-blockchain data centre model for CBDCs in order to
help central banks manage the issuance of currency, prevent
double-spending issues, and protect user privacy. Yao (2018a) con­
ducted an experimental study on a Chinese prototype of a CBDC system.
Qian (2019) introduced a CBDC issuance framework designed for for­
ward contingencies in order to prevent the currency from circulating

indices and financial market variables using a variety of quantitative
techniques.
This paper adds to the CBDCs literature in two main ways. First, it
introduces new CBDCUI and the CBDCAI indices that can capture the
uncertainty and attention around introduction and adoption of CBDCs,
and can be used for further analysis of the impacts of CBDCs on various
financial markets. These indices not only track current CBDCs’ news
trends, but also presents their variations over time and relationships
with other uncertainty and attention measures. Second, this is the first
paper to focus on the effects of CBDC news on financial markets using
very large and comprehensive dataset. We have thoroughly investigated
how CBDC news can impact cryptocurrency markets, commercial
banking sectors, bond markets, foreign exchange markets, stock mar­
kets, uncertainty indices, and gold, and made our data available for
replication.

Based on the CBDCAI’s search term, we then added a new search term,
‘uncert!’, with the link of ‘and’, not ‘or’. Therefore, we obtained a new
search string for CBDCUI. Additionally, we set the option for Group
Duplicate to MODERATE so as to avoid duplicate results as much as
possible2. The search strings for CBDCUI and CBDCAI are as follows:
We should also explain our decision to launch an extra CBDCUI, as
well as the differences between ‘volatility’ and ‘uncertainty’. We are
living in a period of great uncertainty. Indeed, in recent years, various
financial and political events have shaken the world. For example, the
US financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, terrorist attacks,
Brexit, and the current global COVID-19 pandemic, to name but a few.
This series of events has meant that uncertainty has become an impor­
tant variable in modern economies. The CBDCUI not only helps us
identify the uncertainty of CBDC itself, but also allow us to capture how
these uncertainties can disrupt the modern economies. Uncertainty
differs from volatility in the way it is designed and measured, and these
have been analysed differently in the academic literature. In fact,
volatility captures the variability in the price of financial assets.
Therefore, it can be interpreted as a measure of ‘the present’. Simply out,
volatility is akin to a ‘photographs’ of the current situation. Uncertainty
tries to capture ‘the future’ through studying economic, social, and po­
litical sentiment, that in our case, can be extracted from analysis of wide
news coverage of CBDC.

3. Data
3.1. CBDC indices data collection
We conduct multiple search in LexisNexis News & Business using
combinations of keywords relevant to CBDCs. There is no doubt that
‘Central Bank Digital Currency’ and ‘CBDC’ were set as our key search
terms. Moreover, due to our identification of the strongest currencies
(see the literature review, above), we considered what the official nonEnglish terms for ‘Central Bank Digital Currency’ in these countries. The
official language of the US, EU, and the UK is English1. Therefore, the
aforementioned search terms have been translated to Chinese, Japanese,
Russian to ensure comprehensive coverage of the stories in the main
countries that are leading the CBDCs development. Furthermore,
considering Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German are essential
languages in the EU we also translated ‘Central Bank Digital Currency’
into these four languages. Additionally, as a CBDC is a type of digital
currency, and some countries value a CBDC as a tool to counter cryp­
tocurrencies. Therefore, we included ‘Digital currency’ as another key
term. Once done, we searched for the most popular synonyms for digital
currency, which we found to be ‘digital money’, ‘electronic currency’,
‘electronic money’, ‘e-currency’, and ‘e-money’. Therefore, we also set
these five synonyms as key search terms.
Knowing that USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, RUB, JPY, and CNY are heading
towards CBDCs, we substituted the keywords ‘currency’ or ‘money’ with
the official name of these currencies. For example, search terms for the
currency of the United States also included ‘digital dollar’, ‘electronic
dollar’, ‘e-dollar’, ‘digital USD’, ‘electronic USD’, and ‘e-USD’. For
countries where English is not the official language, we not only kept the
English search terms, but also translate them into the particular official
language. Considering that Germany and France have the EU’s strongest
economies, we also translated ’digital euro’, ‘electronic euro’, and ‘eeuro’ into German and French. As we considered Switzerland an English
speaking country, we applied ‘digital Swiss franc’, ‘electronic Swiss
franc’, ‘e-franc’, ‘digital CHF’, ‘electronic CHF’, and ‘e-CHF’. Compiling
these key search terms together generated our search string for CBDCAI.

3.2. CBDC indices’ construction
Our method of CBDC indices’ construction draws from the methods
of Baker et al. (2016) and Huang and Luk (2020) and is in line with the
methods of Lucey et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2022), who created the
cryptocurrency uncertainty indices and cryptocurrency environmental
attention index.
However, considering the database used for the new indices’ con­
struction, our method differs from Baker et al. (2016), Huang and Luk
(2020), Shen et al. (2019), He et al. (2021) and Smales (2022), who
collected data only from American newspapers, Chinese newspapers,
Twitter trends, Baidu trends, or Google trends for constructing their
indices. In contrast, we choose LexisNexis News & Business, a compre­
hensive digital source, as our database because it provides access to a
much larger volume of articles across various publication sources and
over time (including, but not limited to, newswire feeds and media news
transcripts) than Google, Twitter, Baidu and the other traditional trend
search engines offer.
Moreover, we have to point out that one drawback of constructing an
index based on any literature archive is that articles enter and leave the
archive, so the overall volume of articles could vary across publication
sources and time. This is why the standardisation and normalisation
procedures should be processed according to the raw count data because
it allows one to sort the data on the same scale.
For example, the CBDCUI scales the observed value of news articles
in each week by the number of articles that meet the search string Fig. 1
for the same week. The series is then standardised to obtain a time series
dataset as the initial index. Lastly, the initial index is normalised by
adding an average value of 100 to eliminate the potential negative

impacts caused by the overall volume of articles varying across publi­
cation sources and time3. The final series after the normalisation can be
valued as the CBDCUI. Repeating the standardisation and normalisation
procedures by using the search string Fig. 2 can construct the CBDCAI4.
Based on the demonstrations mentioned above, the CBDCUI and

CBDCAI can be calculated as in Equation (1) and Equation 2:
(

where CBDCUIt is the value of the CBDCUI in the weeks t between
January 2015 and June 2021, N1t is the weekly observed value of news
articles on LexisNexis concerning CBDC uncertainty, μ1 is the mean of
these same articles, and σ1 is the standard deviation of such. Adding an
average value of 100 to eliminate the potential negative impacts caused
by the overall volume of articles varies across publication sources and
time.

Applying an average value of 100 as the normalisation value is consistent
with the other new digital currency indices, which are cryptocurrency policy
uncertainty index, cryptocurrency price uncertainty index, cryptocurrency
environmental attention index and NFTs attention index. These new digital
currency indices can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/cryptocurr

(Corbet et al., 2020b), since this digital asset attract the highest attention
from media and general public [Su et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2021], and
also often used a proxy of overall cryptocurrency market volatility [Le
et al., 2021b; Elsayed et al., 2022]. We omitted two composite crypto­
currency indices, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) and the
Royalton CRIX Cypto Index (CRIX), because they only began in 2017
and 2018, respectively, and thus do not cover our entire research period.
Moreover, we applied weekly data in this study, but the weekly available
data of the BGCI and the CRIX are too short and may not be enough to
run a successful and ideal advanced econometric model.
While the above studies would overwhelmingly suggest that intro­
duction of CBDCs will affect commercial banks, there are insufficient
quantitative analysis results that can prove this perspective. Therefore,
we selected the MSCI World Banks Index5 to represent the commercial
banking sector, and investigated the impacts of CBDC indices on com­
mercial banking. In addition, we chose the FTSE World Government
Bond Index as a proxy for bond markets6, since the bond market is a
major segment of the financial system and a key player in monetary
policy transmission mechanisms to other financial markets (Yan et al.,
2018). Barrdear and Kumhof (2021) have investigated the impacts of the
CBDCs issuance on the GDP, compared with government bonds. It is a
popular belief, that a CBDC is a simply digital version of a fiat currency,
while many scholars consider it to be a ’national stablecoin’. Therefore,
it is pertinent to examine its effects on the fiat currencies of countries
that according to the literature are heading towards adopting the
CBDCs, such as China, the US, the EU, the UK, Canada, Russia, and Japan
(Alonso et al., 2021). Moreover, Ciner et al. (2013); Fatum et al. (2017);
Fong and Wong (2020) and Shehadeh et al. (2021) suggest that USD,
EUR, GBP, RUB, JPY, and CNY are the strongest currencies in the world,
and these countries (or blocs) are leading the CBDCs progress world­
wide. We also set the F.X. Spot unit of all the currencies as USD, meaning
that USD units per 1 of another currency (Aslam et al., 2020). Therefore,
the increase in the exchange rate implies the appreciation of the
EUR/GBP/JPY/RUB/CNY against the USD, and vice versa.
To analyse the relationship between our new CBDC indices and other
popular global uncertainty measures we selected the VIX and the USEPU
indices (Umar et al., 2021a). We did not choose the EPU (global) because
it contains only monthly data. While in this paper, we utilise weekly data
for all variables. The effects of CBDCUI and CBDCAI on stock markets is
also captured by including the FTSE All-World Index in our analysis and
we can assign the FTSE All-World Index to represent the all-world stock
markets.7 Lastly, we selected gold as our safe-haven [Baur and Lucey,
2010; Lucey et al., 2017], because our sample covers the period of
COVID-19 pandemic (Yousfi et al., 2021), and safe-haven properties of
gold has been often compared to the other assets [Thampanya et al.,
2020; Le et al., 2021a; Chemkha et al., 2021].

where CBDCAIt is the value of the CBDCAI in the weeks t between
January 2015 and June 2021, N2t is the weekly observed value of Lex­
isNexis news articles concerning the CBDC attention, μ2 is the mean of
these and, σ 2 is the standard deviation of such. Adding an average value
of 100 to eliminate the potential negative impacts caused by the overall
volume of articles varies across publication sources and time.
Based on our index construction method mentioned above, we do not
need to distinguish and sort between the important news stories and the
smaller ones when we construct our CBDC indices. Instead, we just need
to count the weekly observed value of news articles from LexisNexis
News & Business, regardless of where the keywords from Fig. 1 or Fig. 2
are located in an article’s title, main content, comments or elsewhere. In
other words, if the keywords from Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 show in one article’s
title, main content, comments or the other parts, we will collect it and
record this article as one unit for constructing the CBDCUI or CBDCAI.
Moreover, flash events are collected according to the frequency of ar­
ticles that have a same topic. During the CBDC high uncertainty and
attention periods, there are a plethora of articles discussing the same
topic. The flash events can then be extracted from the heated discussion
topics.
Fig. 3 shows the weekly values for the derived indices based on
663,881,640 news items collected between January 2015 and June
2021. According to (Turrin, 2021), Ecuador was the first country to
launch CBDCs, which it did in February 2015 to promote
anti-dollarisation. This implementation is why we selected January
2015 as the beginning of our observation period. The weekly CBDCUI
and CBDCAI indices were annotated in Fig. 4 and display which events
can drive spikes on the indices. The plot allowed us to clearly see how
new CBDC developments could raise the indices, while they could also
be stimulated by other significant events related to cryptocurrencies. We
have listed all of the events captured by our indices in Appendix-A.
3.3. Financial market variable selection
To justify the selections of financial markets in our sample, we
consider previous literature that reported which markets were suscep­
tible to shocked transmitted from CBDCs, or reverse, were immunised
from these shocks. According to the viewpoints expressed by the central
banks around the world, a CBDC is a national tool to counter crypto­
currency volatility and uncertainty [Tronnier et al., 2020; Larina and
Akimov, 2020; Lee et al., 2021a; Koziuk, 2021]. We thus hypothesise
that CBDCUI and CBDCAI may have significant effects on crypto­
currency markets. Specifically, we assume that debates around CBDCs
may affect cryptocurrency price and policy uncertainty, therefore we
decided to also include UCRY Policy and UCRY Price indices in our
sample. It is important to assess how the new CBDC indices are related to
other indices capture uncertainty of the cryptocurrency markets as a
whole. ICEA can capture the public attention and concerns regarding the
environment and cryptocurrency (Wang et al., 2022). Both crypto­
currencies and CBDCs are a type of digital currency, and they will lead to
environmental issues such as increased energy consumption and carbon
emissions during their production and circulation [Chen et al., 2020; Su
et al., 2020b]. Moreover, Laboure et al. (2021) already pointed out the
environmental implications of the introduction of CBDCs. The envi­
ronmental concerns surrounding CBDCs require governments to make
CBDCs sustainable; otherwise, the CBDCs might be seen as against
environmental agendas. These environmental concerns related to digital
currencies could determine whether CBDCs are introduced in some
countries or even decide the fate of CBDCs entirely. Investigating the
interconnections between CBDCUI or CBDCAI and the ICEA could
quantify the extent of CBDCs’ impact on environmental concerns. The
results could be a strong determinant in the increased debates on the
necessity of regulation of CBDCs and proactive government intervention
in the FinTech ecosystem. We also selected the most important crypto­
currency markets leader, i.e. Bitcoin, as one of our financial variables

The MSCI World Banks Index is constructed on large and mid-capitalisation
stocks across 23 developed market countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Swe­
den, Switzerland, the UK, and the US). All stocks in the MSCI World Banks
Index are classified in the Banks industry group.

The FTSE World Government Bond Index is a broad benchmark for the
global sovereign fixed income market. It measures the performance of fixedrate, local currency, investment-grade sovereign bonds. The FTSE WGBI com­
prises sovereign debt from over 20 countries and is denominated in a variety of
currencies.

methodologies that can be used to capture the impact of Uncertainty and
Attention indices on financial markets. The DCC-GARCH model, wavelet
analysis, and the VAR model (SVAR structural shock analysis) are the
three most popular and straightforward methodologies for analysing of
the relationships between different financial variables. Applying the
DCC-GARCH model, Akyildirim et al. (2020) analysed the relationship
between the price volatility of cryptocurrencies and the implied vola­
tilities of VIX and VSTOXX (EURO STOXX 50 indices Volatility Index).
Aepni et al. (2021) investigated the time-varying co-movements be­
tween Turkish sovereign yield curve factors and oil price shocks. Xie and
Zhu (2021) examined the stabilisation effects of economic policy un­
certainty (EPU) on gold futures market and spot market price volatility.
Several recent studies have used wavelet-analysis to investigate the
structure of financial indices’ correlation with various financial asset
classes. For instance, Conlon et al. (2018) used the continuous wavelet
transformation to check the relationship between gold and inflation, as
well as gold’s ability to hedge against inflation dynamically. Sharif et al.
(2020) analysed the connection between COVID-19, oil prices, stock
markets, geopolitical risks, and EPU in the United States by applying the
time-frequency coherence wavelet method. Moreover, Shahzad et al.
(2021) examined the dynamics relationships between realised variances
and semi-variances of the six strongest currencies by fitting wavelet
squared coherence and wavelet cohesion. The VAR model, and its SVAR
structural analysis tools, are widely used in issuing new financial
indices. Baker et al. (2016) launched the EPU index and analysed its
impact on economic activities (S&P 500 index, VIX, industrial produc­
tion, and unemployment rate). Huang and Luk (2020) issued China
Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (China’s EPU) to examine the impact
of its shocks on macroeconomic variables (equity price, deposit rate,
unemployment rate, and output volume). Lucey et al. (2021) and Wang
et al. (2022) built the UCRY Policy, UCRY Price and ICEA. Then, these
studies performed the IRF, FEVD, and HD tests to further investigate the
impacts of the three indices on financial and commodities assets. In this
paper, we used the VAR model to check the effectiveness and validity of
two new CBDC indices. Moreover, the SVAR model can investigate how
CBDC indices can affect the financial variables and contribute to their
variations. Furthermore, to determine the interconnections between
CBDC indices and each financial variable, we employed the DCC-GARCH
model as the most suitable and straightforward method for achieving
this goal.

The SVAR model allows for three tools: the impulse response func­
tion (IRF), forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), and historical
decomposition (HD). These are used to capture the dynamic and
instantaneous impacts of structural shocks within the variable system
(see Equation 4). The three elements can be broadly defined as follows.

The main uses of the VAR model are forecasting and structural
analysis Lütkepohl (2005). The standard VAR is a reduced form model,
and can be expressed as Fig. 3:

World Banks Index, VIX, USEPU, FTSE All-World Index, EUR/USD, GBP/
USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, CNY/USD, gold, Bitcoin and FTSE World
Government Bond Index could react contemporaneously to uncertainty
or attention shocks.
The standard VAR is a reduced form model designed for stationary
data forms. If economic theory is used to provide links between forecast
errors and fundamental structural shocks, the SVAR model can be used.
Accordingly, structural shocks on the system variables yt based on the
VAR can be calculated as Equation (5):

4.1.1. Impulse Response Function
When a VAR process is stationary, it can be said it has a movingaverage (MA) representation. In the MA representation, the IRF can
trace the marginal effect of a shock to one variable by counterfactual
experiment. The MA representation can be expressed as Equation 7:

(3)

where yt is a K × 1 dimensional vector of variables observed at time t.
A1 , A2 , ⋯, Ap− 1 , Ap are K × K coefficient matrices. Dt is a vector of
deterministic terms, and Ξ+ is the coefficient matrices corresponding
with Dt . ut is a k-dimensional unobservable zero mean vector white noise
process, and has covariance matrix Σu . ut also denotes the reduced form
disturbance.
In order to investigate the relationship between our indices and
economic activities, we established a variable system based on the VAR
model. The CBDCUI, the CBDCAI, the UCRY Policy, the UCRY Price, the
ICEA, the MSCI World Banks Index, the FTSE World Government Bond
Index, the VIX, the US EPU, the FTSE All-World Index, and the EUR/
USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, and CNY/USD exchange rates, as
well as the price of gold and Bitcoin, were selected as the system vari­
ables. We ordered variables as indicated by Equation 4:

where ut is a k-dimensional unobservable zero mean vector white noise

process, and has covariance matrix Σu . Φi = JAi J and J =
[Ik : 0 : 0 : ⋯ : 0]. Ai are summable.

number of series. This calculation result suggested a maximum lag value
of 13. Second, we calculated the optimal lag value based on the AIC, HQ,
SC and FPE information criteria from lag max = 1 to lag max = 13. The
SVAR optimal lag calculation results are displayed in the Table 8,
Appendix B - Table. Except for the AIC criteria in lag max = 13, 12 and 11
suggest 13, 12, 11 as the optimal lag, respectively. The other informa­
tion criteria in each lag max value all suggest that 1 is the optimal lag.
Third, we excluded 13, 12, 11 as the optimal lag by testing how sta­
tionary the SVAR model stayed. The results in the Table B3, Appendix B Table show that the SVAR model cannot keep stationary when the lag is
13, 12, or 11, but the SVAR is a stationary model when the lag is 18.
Moreover, Lütkepohl (2005) suggests that a large lag should not be
added into a variable system when one has a small number of obser­
vations and a comparatively large number of variables. Therefore, we
decided to select 1 as the optimal lag value.

the h-step forecast error variance of variable k. ωkj,h can decompose the
contribution of the j-th εt innovation to the h-step forecast error variance
of variable k.

4.1.3. Historical Decomposition
ut can be decomposed into different structural components in the HD
- much like what has been analysed above. Equation 7, the MA repre­
sentation can be further denoted as Equation 9:

where the time series can be decomposed into the estimate structural
shocks ε from time 1 to time t, and the inestimable structural shocks ε
preceding the dataset’s start point.
∑
In a stationary VAR process, the ∞
i=t Φi,t ut− i can have a constantly
diminishing impact on the yt as time t increases, which can contribute to
a reasonable approximation. This process can be denoted as Equation
10:

4.2. Dynamic conditional correlation model specification
The key preconditions to apply a GARCH model is that the time series
data is stationary with ARCH effects. The results in Table 1 Panel C
confirms that all the time series variables are stationarity in the
continuously compounded returns. Moreover, Table B6 in Appendix B Table indicates that all the variables have ARCH effects in 1, 2 and 3
orders. The above statistical evidence confirmed that the GARCH-type
models were appropriate to use.
The DCC model, proposed by Engle (2002), enables the identification
of the time-varying correlation among different variables. Many studies
have applied multivariate GARCH-DCC models to estimate the DCCs
[Celık, 2012; Jones and Olson, 2013; Ciner et al., 2013]. However,
finding a suitable GARCH-type model is an extremely challenging task.
There are five popular standard GARCH competing models in the digital
currency field Chu et al. (2017): SGARCH(p,q), EGARCH(p,q), IGARCH
(p,q), APARCH(p,q) and GJR-GARCH(p,q). We fitted these five
GARCH-type models by the method of maximum likelihood, and the
discrimination among them is identified by the AIC, BIC, SC and HQ
information criteria. The smaller the values of these criteria, the better
the fit. Table B7, Table B8, Table B9 and Table B10 in Appendix B - Table
give the GJR-GARCH model as the model with smallest values of AIC,
BIC, SC and HQ for each variable.
The DCC-GJR-GARCH model is an innovative extension of the
GARCH model, expanded by including an additional leverage term that
detects asymmetries, and it can assess an asymmetric response to posi­
tive and negative shocks. The latest research suggests that the DCC-GJRGARCH model outperforms other standard GARCH competing models in
identifying financial variables’ DCC [Laurent et al., 2012; Al Mamun
et al., 2020; Corbet et al., 2021].

We first set rt = [r1,t , ⋯, rn,t ] and εt = [ε1,t , ⋯, εn,t ] as the (n × 1)
vector of financial time series returns and the vector of return residuals,
respectively. μ denotes a vector of constant with length n. ψ represents
the coefficient vector of the autoregressive terms. Second, set hi,t as the
parallel conditional volatilities captured from the univariate GARCH
process. Therefore, the mean equation with zero mean normally
distributed return series can be given as Equation 13:

(10)

Φi,t ut− i ,
i=1

Therefore, the HD is equal to the weighted sums, which can be
measured as the contribution of shock j on variable k in the stationary
VAR process. Consequently, the HD can be denoted as Equation 11:
̂

Based on the prior ordering in the SVAR Cholesky decomposition, the
relationship between reduced form residuals and structural shocks are
shown in Equation 12:

Second, we set It− 1 = 0 if εt− 1 ≥ 0, otherwise It− 1 = 1. Moreover, the
asymmetric effect of positive and negative shocks are identified by λ (the
leverage coefficient). Based on the GJR - GARCH (1,1) model, the con­
ditional volatility h2i,t can be expressed as Equation 14:

where, ut denotes the reduced form disturbances (forecast errors) at time
t, εt denotes the structural shocks at time t.
This study adds 1 lag to the SVAR model and the three structural
shock analysis tools. The optimal lag value of 1 for our variable system
Equation 4 and SVAR model was selected based on the following pro­
cedures. First, we calculated the maximum lag value by applying the
equation (Winker and Maringer, 2004) and (Lütkepohl, 2005): Lag.max
( N)
= 10 × ln m
, where N is the number of observations and m is the

Fig. 5. The dynamics of variables returns

where, when λ < 0, the negative shocks can have a less of a significant effect
on volatility than positive shocks, and when λ > 0, the positive shocks can
have a less significant effect on volatility than negative ones. If parameters ω,
α, β, and λ can satisfy the conditions of ω > 0, α, β, λ ≥ 0, and λ + (α + β)/2
< 1, Equation 14 can always hold for a positive and stationarity volatility
process [Glosten et al., 1993; Al Mamun et al., 2020].
Third, based on the constant conditional correlation model (Boller­
slev, 1990), the constant conditional correlation Ht can be denoted as
Equation 15:

where, Rt = [ρij,r ] is the n × n time-varying correlation matrix that is
√̅̅̅̅̅̅
computed by the standardised residuals (i.e., zi,t = εi,t / hi,t computed
from the univariate GARCH estimates).
Moreover, based on the DCC model explanations in (Engle, 2002),
we can further reach Equation 17, and Equation 18, and Equation 19:
( )− 1
( )− 1
Rt = Q∗t 2 × Qt Q∗t 2 ,

(15)

Ht = Dt × R × Dt ,

D−t 1

(17)
′

Qt = (1 − α − β)Qs + αZt− 1 Zt− 1 + βQt− 1 ,

√̅̅̅̅̅̅
where, Dt = diag hi,t and it is the diagonal matrix of the conditional
variances, R = [ρij ] is the n × n correlation matrix. Since εt = D−t 1 rt , we

(

D−t 1 ,

can reach Et− 1 [εt ] = 0 and R = Et− 1 [εt εt ] =
× Ht ×
where Et [⋅] is
the conditional expectation on εt , εt− 1 , ⋯, εt− n .
Based on the Equation 15, a simple estimate of R is the unconditional
correlation matrix of the standardised residuals. When R is set as timevarying, we can reach a dynamic correlation model, which can be
denoted as Equation 16:

where, Qt = (qij,t ) denotes the time-varying correlation matrix of Zt , and
Q∗t = diag(Qt ). Qs denotes the n × n unconditional variance matrix of Zt ,

and Qs = E[Zt Zt ]. α, and β are non-negative scalars as long as α + β < 1.
Finally, we can give the element of the conditional correlation matrix
ρij,t as Equation 20:

The time-varying of the dynamic returns for each variable can be
seen in Fig. 5. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the variable
system Equation 4. We opted for weekly data to process the empirical
analysis. Following (Long et al., 2021), digital currency markets are
enormously volatile, meaning that there are many outliers in the very
short-term data period (1-min, 30-mins, or daily data). Weekly data is
most suitable for analysing digital currency variables and effectively
showcases the data’s characteristics. We collected CBDCUI and CBDCAI
from LexisNexis News & Business. UCRY Policy Index, UCRY Price
Index, and ICEA were all collected from Cryptocurrency Indices9. We
collected the MSCI World Banks Index, VIX, FTSE World Government
Bond Index, FTSE All-World Index, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD,
RUB/USD, CNY/USD, and gold and Bitcoin prices from Thomson Reu­
ters. USEPU10 was collected from the EPU. Panel A presents the
descriptive statistics for the raw data; panel B displays the descriptive
statistics for the log return of the raw data; and panel C shows the
descriptive statistics for the continuously compounded returns of the
raw data. We calculated the continuously compounded returns as
volatility by processing the first-difference in the logarithmic values of
two consecutive prices, expressed as: CCRi,t = ln(Pi,t /Pi,t− 1 ) × 100,
where CCRi,t denotes continuously compounded returns for index i at
time t, and Pit stands for the price of index i at time t.
As shown in Table 1, we will explain our raw data from the three
perspectives of frequency distribution, central tendency, and dispersion.
The indices had the same mean values - even when we expanded the
decimal point to six. The value of CBDCUI’s range was greater than the
CBDCAI’s, causing the former to have a lower minimum value and a
higher maximum value than the latter. The standard deviation values of
CBDCUI and CBDCAI were almost identical, and the differences in
standard deviation were apparent when we set the decimal point to nine.
The CBDCAI had higher skewness and kurtosis valued than the CBDCUI.
Furthermore, the skewness and kurtosis values of these two variables
were positive. These results indicate that an asymmetrical probability
distribution of both indices (the mean was greater than the median, and
the tail is on the right side), their being leptokurtic, and rejecting the
normal distribution, which was confirmed by the Jarque-Bera tests.
Based on the unit root test (ADF, KPSS, and PP) results, unit roots con­
tained in all the (raw) variables were a non-stationary time series.

To investigate the indices’ structural shocks on cryptocurrency,
foreign exchange and stock markets as well as banking sectors, uncer­
tainty indices and safe-haven gold, we applied the IRF, FEVD and HD
tests derived from the SVAR model. By using the DCC-GJR-GARCH
model, we can further examine the interconnections between CBDC
indices and financial markets. We will discuss the results of these tests,
including their potential underlying causes in full detail in the following
subsections. We demonstrate that CBDC indices have a significant
negative relationship with the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks
Index, USEPU and the FTSE All-World Index, and a positive one with
that of cryptocurrency markets, bond markets, foreign exchange mar­
kets, VIX and gold. Considering that the empirical findings from the two
econometrics models are identical, we will not interpret them in each
subsection for the sake of brevity. However, we will develop an inde­
pendent subsection at the end of the current one to fully explain the
empirical findings and further discuss the underlying excuses.

Fig. 6. CBDCUI shocks to other variables

According to Lütkepohl (2005) and Durlauf and Blume (2010), a
VAR model requires every variable running in the model to be station­
ary. Therefore, we calculated the log return to Equation 4. The results
are shown in Equation 1 in Panel B. Unfortunately, unit roots still existed
in variable system Equation 4 confirmed by the ADF, PP, and KPSS tests.
Therefore, we calculated the continuously compounded returns to
Equation 4. The results are shown in Equation 1 Panel C indicating the
variables showed stationarity in the continuously compounded returns.
Baker et al. (2016) used EPU raw data, the log of the S&P 500 Index, and
the employment and industrial production log to process the IRF anal­
ysis. However, Lütkepohl (2005) and Corbet et al. (2021) indicated that
continuously compounded return is more suitable than the log return for
analysing the volatility characteristics. As such, we used the continu­
ously compounded returns of Equation 4 to run the VAR and
DCC-GARCH models.
Table 2 unveils the Pearson correlation relationship between each
variable. We can observe that the CBDCUI and CBDCAI indices posi­
tively correlated with the volatility of UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, and
ICEA indices at the 1% significance level. When compared with CBDCAI,
CBDCUI has a stronger positive correlation relationship with the vola­
tility of UCRY Policy (0.577 > 0.354) and UCRY Price (0.578 > 0.355),
but the correlation relationship is weaker with the volatility of ICEA
(0.412 < 0.536). Furthermore, the CBDCAI and CBDCUI indices are also
significantly positively correlated with the volatility of VIX, and all ex­
change rates EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, CNY/USD, as
well as with gold, Bitcoin, and the FTSE World Government Bond Index.
However, we found negative correlation between both CBDC indices
and the volatility of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE
All-World Index.

5.2. CBDC shocks on the dynamics of financial variables volatility
In this subsection, we examine the effects of the indices’ shocks on
the financial variables’ volatilities in Equation 4 from different time
horizons. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show that the impulse response of financial
variables in the structural CBDCUI is to continuously compound returns,
as well as for CBDCAI shocks in short-, mid-, and long-term time hori­
zons. 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and >10 represent the very short-term,
short-term, mid-term 1, mid-term 2, long-term, and very long-term,
respectively.
As for CBDCUI shocks on the dynamics of financial variables’ vola­
tility, we can draw several inferences from Fig. 6. First, we have
empirically verified that CBDCUI shocks can significantly increase the
volatilities of UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, ICEA, VIX, EUR/USD, GBP/
USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, CNY/USD, gold, Bitcoin and the FTSE World
Government Bond Index in the very short-term period. However, this
increase tends to quickly drop to a negative value at the end of this
period (expect for RUB/USD and CNY/USD). Moreover, CBDCUI shocks
can significantly decrease the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks
Index, USEPU, and the FTSE All-World Index in the very short-term
period - although this decrease tends to reverse rather rapidly (except
for the MSCI World Banks Index). Second, CBDCUI shocks can slightly
decrease the volatilities of UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, ICEA, the MSCI
World Banks Index, VIX, USEPU, FTSE All World Index, EUR/USD, GBP/
USD, JPY/USD, gold and the FTSE World Government Bond Index in the
short-term, and maintains an increasing growth trend. Additionally,
CBDCUI shocks can slightly increase the volatilities of RUB/USD, CNY/
USD, and Bitcoin in the short-term period, and maintains a decreasing
growth trend. Third, although CBDCUI can still slightly affect financial
variables from the mid-term, the selected financial markets and indices’
responses tend to quickly show a convergence trend.

Based on these three inferences mentioned above, we can draw two
short conclusions that, CBDCUI shocks can significantly increase the
volatilities of UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, ICEA, VIX, EUR/USD, GBP/
USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, CNY/USD, gold, Bitcoin and the FTSE World
Government Bond Index as a whole. Moreover, CBDCUI shocks can also

significantly decrease the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index,
USEPU, and the FTSE All-World Index overall.
As for CBDCAI shocks, we can also draw several inferences from
Fig. 7. First, we empirically verified that CBDCAI shocks can signifi­
cantly increase the volatilities of UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, ICEA, VIX,

to 2.4482%) had a greater contribution to the CBDCUI’s fluctuations.
Therefore, a novel finding is cryptocurrency environmental attention
contributed more to the CBDCUI variations than cryptocurrency policy
uncertainty and cryptocurrency price uncertainty. As for the five foreign
exchange rate variables, JPY/USD (0.8366% to 0.8724%) was the most
important for CBDCUI variations. Banking sectors (i.e. MSCI WBI:
0.0322%), Stock markets (i.e. FTSE AWI: 0.2905%), Gold (0.03%),
Bitcoin (0.1%) and bond markets (i.e. FTSE WGBI: 0.0215%) can only be
used to explain a small part of the CBDCUI’s variations.
From Fig. 8 and Table 3, the dominant role that a shock from the
CBDCAI (93.8919% to 94.8640%) could play in explaining variations in
the CBDCAI FEVD. However, the CBDCUI’s explanation power in the
FEVD of CBDCAI was significantly lower than that of the CBDCAI. Due to
the dominant role of the CBDCAI, and the lower importance of the
CBDCUI’s contributions in the FEVD of CBDCAI, the contributions from
the other variables become more significant on the percentage level
(despite each variable’s contribution value being lower than those in the
CBDCUI FEVD). For example, the contributions from the three crypto­
currencies have become more critical to the CBDCAI FEVD. Compared
with the joint contributions of the ICEA with UCRY Policy and UCRY
Price, ICEA (0.9651% to 1.2403%) still had the leading role. Compared
with the three world indices, the MSCI World Banks Index was more
relevant (0.3625% 0.3861%) than the FTSE All-World Index (0.0251%)
and the FTSE World Government Bond Index (0.0954%) in explaining
the CBDCAI’s FEVD. Compared with the two uncertainty indices
together, the VIX (0.5578% to 0.5678%) was relatively more important
than the USEPU (0.0132% to 0.0854%) in explaining the FEVD of
CBDCAI. Although JPY/USD (0.5152% to 0.5147%) was still important
for the FEVD of CBDCAI among other foreign exchange rates, the RUB/
USD (0.8386% to 0.8413%) had the greatest contribution to the
CBDCAI’s variations. Surprisingly, although China is leading the CBDC
revolution, CNY/USD (0.0205% to 0.0588%) was relatively less
important in explaining the variations in the CBDCAI FEVD. Compared
with the role of Bitcoin in CBDCUI FEVD, Bitcoin is relatively more
important (0.3250% to 0.3582%) in explaining the FEVD of CBDCAI.
Moreover, we found that gold (4.25E-05) did not greatly contribute to
the CBDCAI’s variations.

CNY/USD and the FTSE World Government Bond Index in the very
short-term period. CBDCAI shocks on UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, and VIX
show an increasing trend, whereas CBDCAI shocks on the ICEA, CNY/
USD and the FTSE World Government Bond Index display a decreasing
trend. CBDCAI shocks can significantly decrease the volatilities of the
MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE All-World Index in the
very short-term, which maintains an increasing trend. CBDCAI shocks
can significantly increase, but also can slightly decrease (the initial
significant increase is followed by a slight decrease), the volatilities of
EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, gold, and Bitcoin in the
short-term. Additionally, for these financial variables, positive shocks
tend to have a greater effect in the very short-term. Second, slightly
negative shocks from the CBDCAI have a greater short-term effect for all
of the variables. However, as for the variables which receive positive
shocks from the CBDCAI at the very short-term period, the small nega­
tive shocks from CBDCAI at the short-term are not significant enough to
contribute a significantly negative effect as a whole, the positive shock
results are still dominant in the final results. Third, although the CBDCAI
can still have positive or negative effects on financial variables at the
mid- or long-term, the responses of the financial variables begin to
converge from the former.
These three inferences illustrated above can lead to three short
conclusions. First, the results of CBDCAI shocks on the dynamics of
financial variables’ volatility are the same as those relating to CBDCUI
shocks. Second, CBDCAI shocks can significantly increase the volatilities
of UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, ICEA, VIX, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD,
RUB/USD, CNY/USD, gold, Bitcoin and the FTSE World Government
Bond Index. Third, CBDCAI shocks can significantly decrease the vola­
tilities of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE All-World
Index.
5.3. Contributions of CBDC disturbances to the variation of financial
variables’ volatility
From Fig. 8 and Table 3, we can see that a shock from the CBDCUI
(100% to 85.0512%) could play a non-trivial role in explaining varia­
tions in the CBDCUI FEVD. CBDCAI (7.8467% to 9.0344%) was also a
relatively significant variable in explaining variations in the CBDCUI
FEVD. Considering the three cryptocurrency indices, the ICEA (2.4091%

5.4. Cumulative contributions of CBDC disturbances to the financial
variables’ volatility

It is worth noting that CBDC’s progress in the UK may have signifi­
cantly and positively affected the CBDCUI’s HD results in the first larger
cluster. In other words, between March 2015 to July 2015, the UK’s new
CBDC progress could have increased the CBDCUI. Analysing the second
larger cluster period with the third and fourth also yielded several
interesting findings. First, new CBDC developments (e.g., the digitalCAD, digital-EUR, digital-USD, etc,) significantly decreased CBDC un­
certainties. However, it is also worth noting that the UK’s CBDC per­
formed differently, and thus increased CBDC uncertainty before the
larger cluster in period four. Besides, perhaps because the Renminbi is
not a free-float currency, it is hard to place it into the first portfolio
position. Alternatively, many regulators and investors are concerned
that the digital-RMB could challenge the USD’s international hegemony.
The new developments of digital-RMB could increase CBDC uncertainty,
that is, until Hong Kong helps with its offshore digital-CNH test. Second,
negative CBDC news can significantly increase CBDC uncertainties. For
example, the Danish Central Bank’s cancellation of its CBDC plans, the
Deutsche Bundesbank’s warning that there will be no CBDC in the Eurozone, and the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Schweizerische Natio­
nalbank’s anti-CBDC plans. Furthermore, significant cryptocurrency
events, as well as COVID-19, have seemingly increased CBDC
uncertainties.
The contributions of the estimated CBDCAI shocks to the evolution of
the financial variables’ volatilities are changing over time, and we
clearly noted the presence of four larger clusters between May 2016,
December 2017, January 2018, June 2019 to July 2019, and March
2021 to July 2021. We also successfully captured which significant
events could cause these larger positive or negative shocks. These shocks
match the expectations of the public to a certain extent. For example,
digital-CAD, digital-USD, digital-RMB, and the Bahamas Sand Dollar
prepaid card, as well as other forms of new CBDC progress, could
significantly and positively affect the CBDCAI’s HD results. However,
during the 2021 cryptocurrency bull market, South Korea-based Shin­
han Bank and the Central Bank of Russia’s new CBDC announcements
showed a significantly negative impact on the CBDCAI’s HD results.
Furthermore, we can notice that certain significant events from the
cryptocurrency market could also have significantly positive impacts on
the CBDCAI’s HD results. For example, Bitcoin’s one-year bull market,
and its record highs for both price and transaction values. In terms of the
negative shocks, some negative CBDC news could have significantly

While Fig. 8 and Table 3 assess the timing and magnitude of the
indices’ responses to a typical structural shock, they do not quantify how
much of each shock explains the historical fluctuations in the CBDCUI
and CBDCAI. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the historical evo­
lution of both indices, and the contribution of each of the structural
shocks to fluctuations in both, mainly following major historical epi­
sodes. Based on the HD method introduced in the previous section, Fig. 9
and Fig. 10 present the cumulative contributions of CBDCUI and
CBDCAI disturbances to the volatilities of financial variables under dy­
namic economic environments. The contribution of CBDCUI shocks is
given in the red, while the contribution of CBDCAI is presented in light
blue.
Several conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. Firstly, we
found that both the cumulative positive and negative effects of CBDCUI
disturbances on financial variables were larger than those of the
CBDCAI. The reasons seem abundantly clear: the uncertainty index
fluctuates more than the attention index, and financial markets are also
more sensitive to shocks from uncertainty indices. Our findings recon­
firm those of [Lucey et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022]. Secondly, the
contributions of the estimated CBDCUI shocks to the evolution of the
financial variables’ volatilities changed over time, and we found that
they tended to be larger between March 2015 to July 2015, February
2017 to December 2018, June 2019 to August 2019, and April 2020 to
July 2021. Generally speaking, these positive or negative shocks appear
perfectly reasonable. Indeed, in the first larger cluster period, we found
that some good news about CBDC could have significantly negative
shocks on the CBDCUI’s HD results. For example, dollarisation and the
launch of an electronic monetary system in Ecuador. Furthermore, new
government CBDC regulations also negatively affected the CBDCUI’s HD
results. For example, the Chinese government revised its Anti-Money
Laundering Law because digital currency makes Anti-Money Laun­
dering enforcement challenging. Regarding the positive shocks in the
first larger cluster, we clearly found that the new digital money process
in commercial banks could have significant positive effects on the
CBDCUI’s HD results. For example, M-payment progresses in Brazil,
Colombia, and Peru, and PayPal’s announcement of their acquisition of
Xoom.

negative impacts on CBDCAI’s HD results. For instance, the Swiss town
of Zug is planning to allow its residents to use Bitcoin to pay for
municipal services; and the aforementioned plans of the Danish Central
Bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, and the Schweizerische National Bank.
Additionally, potential CBDC concerns, such as how it cannot be applied
to less developed areas due to poor internet connections. Moreover, due
to its reliance on smart devices and technology, CBDC may not be ideally
suited to the elderly. Other concerns include CBDC’s energy consump­
tion and environmental issues, and free-float concerns regarding the
digital-RMB. More details about these events can be found in the Ap­
pendix-A.

Panel B (1), the p-values of the results of the diagnostic tests mentioned
above are all greater than 0.05, which cannot reject the null hypothesis
of no autocorrelation, no hypothesis and abnormal distribution of re­
siduals, separately. Moreover, the best-match ARIMA(p,d,q) models for
the 17 variables’ residuals are all ARIMA(0,0,0), as shown in Panel B (2),
indicating that the residuals’ time series is stationary. In this way, we
can infer that the SVAR model does not suffer autocorrelation and het­
eroscedasticity. Moreover, the residuals in the SVAR model are also
normally distributed and stationary. Therefore, we can verify the cor­
rectness of the SVAR model and that lag 1 is the optimal lag.

5.5. Diagnostic tests for SVAR

Table 4 and Table 5 displays the bivariate DCC-GJR-GARCH (1,1)
model results for CBDCUI/CBDCAI and each financial variable in
Equation 4.
Regarding the interconnections between the CBDCUI and financial
variables, as shown in Panel A of Table 4, the ARCH, GARCH and GJR
parameters were statistically significant at the 10% level for all vari­
ables. These statistical results indicate that the application of the DCCGJR-GARCH (1,1) models between CBDCUI and the other variables in
Equation 4 is appropriate and reasonable. Panel B of Table 4 reveals the
DCC between the CBDCUI’s volatility and other financial variables. This
allowed us to obtain three findings. First, the CBDCUI had a positive and

We processed several diagnostic tests for the SVAR to check the
validity of this model and to further confirm that lag 1 is the optimal lag.
We tested the autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity and the properties of
the residuals for the SVAR model. Autocorrelation and hetero­
scedasticity are tested by the portmanteau test (asymptotic) and ARCH
(multivariate) tests, respectively. Using the Jarque-Bera test, skewness
(multivariate) and kurtosis (multivariate) are examined to ensure
normal distribution of the residuals. The stationarity of the residuals is
investigated by the ARIMA test. The diagnostic test results are presented
in Panel B (1) and (2) of the Table B2. As seen in the statistic results in

Fig. 11. CBDCUI dynamic condition correlation

statistically significant DCC with the volatility of UCRY Policy, UCRY
Price, ICEA, VIX, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, CNY/USD,
gold, Bitcoin and the FTSE World Government Bond Index in both the
short- (a) and long-term (b). Second, the CBDCUI had a significantly
small positive DCC with the volatility of the MSCI World Bank Index and
FTSE All-World Index in the short-term, but a significantly negative DCC
with both indices in the long-term. The value of b was significantly
greater than a. Therefore, we can infer that the CBDCUI had a signifi­
cantly negative DCC with the MSCI World Bank Index and FTSE AllWorld Index in general. Third, the CBDCUI had a significantly nega­
tive DCC with the volatility of USEPU in both the short- and long-term.
In terms of the interconnections between the CBDCAI and financial
variables, as shown in Panel A of Table 5, the ARCH, GARCH and GJR
parameters were statistically significant at the 10% level for all vari­
ables. These statistical results indicate that the application of the DCCGJR-GARCH (1,1) models between CBDCAI and the other variables in
Equation 4 is appropriate and reasonable. Panel B of Table 5 reveals the
DCC between the CBDCAI and other financial variables, thus leading to
three results. First, the CBDCAI had a significantly positive DCC with the
volatility of UCRY Policy, UCRY Price, ICEA, VIX, GBP/USD and the
FTSE World Government Bond Index in both the short- and long-term.
Second, the CBDCAI had a significantly small negative DCC with the
volatility of EUR/USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, CNY/USD, gold, and Bit­
coin in the short-term, but has a significantly positive one in the longterm. Furthermore, the value of b was significantly greater than that
of a. Therefore, we can infer that the CBDCAI has a significantly positive
DCC with the volatility of EUR/USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD, CNY/USD,
gold, and Bitcoin in general. Third, the CBDCAI had a significantly
negative DCC with the volatility of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU,
and FTSE All-World Index in both short- and long-term, although the
long-term effects were significantly stronger.

Regarding the CBDCUI and CBDCAI DCC results, it is worth noting
that the volatilities of the same financial variables reacted differently to
both indices. For example, compared with the CBDCUI, the volatility of
the UCRY Policy had a stronger long- and short-term DCC relationship
with the CBDCAI. Moreover, the volatility of the UCRY Price and ICEA
had a stronger short-term DCC relationship with the CBDCAI. However,
these stronger relationships did not exist in the long-term, and the
volatility of the UCRY Price and ICEA were more sensitive to the CBDCUI
in the long-term (0.8457 > 0.8452, 0.6829 > 0.000001).
Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 displays the time-varying correlations between
CBDCUI/CBDCAI and each financial variable in Equation 4.
As for the CBDCUI, the dynamic correlations between changes in the
Bitcoin, CNY/USD, EUR/USD, gold, ICEA, RUB/USD, UCRY price, VIX
and the FTSE World Government Bond Index were significantly positive
across the entire research period. However, some details require further
explanation. The maximum dynamic correlation value between the
CBDCUI and Bitcoin, i.e., 0.2786, occurred on 2020-03-20, while the
minimum value, i.e., 0.0318, occurred on 2021-04-30. The dynamic
correlations between the CBDCUI and CNY/USD showed a significant
increase trend after China’s Central Bank began to both test and launch
CBDC. Three peaks are visible in the dynamic correlation between the
CBDCUI and EUR/USD. The first one is the cryptocurrency bear market
and the China-US trade war of 2018-19. The second was due to Brexit in
the second half of 2019, and the third occurred due to the crypto­
currency bull market in 2021. Regarding the CBDCUI and gold, there
was a significant cliff-like drop in 2017-18, which may have been caused
by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike. The most volatile dynamic
correlation relationships exist in the CBDCUI and VIX, which may
explain why some refer to the VIX as a fear index. The dynamic corre­
lation values between the CBDCUI and GBP/USD, CBDCUI and JPY/
USD, CBDCUI and MSCI World Bank Index, and the CBDCUI and UCRY

Policy were both significantly partially positive and negative11. From
the negative dynamic correlation periods, we found that, generally
speaking, the partial significantly positive dynamic correlations were
the most significant relationships between the CBDCUI and the UCRY
Policy, GBP/USD, and JPY/USD. Moreover, the partial significantly
negative dynamic correlations were the foremost relationships between
the CBDCUI and MSCI World Bank Index. We found the degrees of dy­
namic correlations between changes in the CBDCUI and USEPU, and the
CBDCUI and FTSE All-World Index were negative throughout the entire
research period, thereby providing the potential ability of the hedging
strategy.
Regarding the CBDCAI, the degrees of dynamic correlations between
changes in the CBDCAI and Bitcoin, CNY/USD, EUR/USD, GBP/USD,
gold, ICEA, UCRY Policy, and VIX were positive and statistically sig­
nificant throughout the whole research period. These empirical results
imply that one unit increase in CBDC attention can increase the vola­
tilities of Bitcoin, CNY/USD, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, Gold, ICEA, UCRY
Policy, and VIX. The dynamic correlation values between the CBDCAI
and JPY/USD, the CBDCAI and RUB/USD, the CBDCAI and UCRY Price,
and the CBDCAI and FTSE World Government Bond Index were both
significantly partially positive and negative12. From the negative dy­
namic correlations periods, we found that, generally speaking, the par­
tial significantly positive dynamic correlations to be the most important
relationships between the CBDCAI and UCRY Price, RUB/USD, JPY/
USD, and the FTSE World Government Bond Index. The degrees of dy­
namic correlations between changes in the CBDCAI and FTSE All-World

Index, CBDCAI and MSCI World Banks Index, and CBDCAI and USEPU
were negative throughout the whole research period, thus evidencing
the potential availability of the hedging strategy.
5.7. Diagnostic tests for DCC-GJR-GARCH (1,1)
Following the guidance of Huber (2004), one efficient and robust
GARCH-type-DCC (p,q) model should pass the following seven criteria:
(1) the sum of the coefficient values of the ARCH (p) and GARCH (q) is
greater than 0 and less than 1; (2) the significance level of these DCC
parameters should less than 0.1; (3) the morphological parameter of the
joint distribution should be significant; (4) DCC keeps a dynamic
probability; (5) no ARCH effects in the residuals of the fitted
DCC-GJR-GARCH (1, 1) models; (6) if we assume that the standardised
errors follow a multivariate normal distribution in the DCC-GJR-GARCH
(1,1) models, we should confirm that the residuals of the estimated
models are normally distributed; (7) no serial correlation in the squared
residuals. We processed diagnostic tests for the fitted DCC-GJR-GARCH
(1,1) models by using the seven criteria mentioned above.
The diagnostic test results for each fitted DCC-GJR-GARCH (1,1)
model are presented in Table 4 and Table 5. The sum of the coefficient
values of the ARCH (1) and GARCH (1) for each fitted DCC-GJR-GARCH
(1,1) model are all greater than 0 and less than 1. Parameters a and b
represent the DCC short-run volatility impact and DCC long-run vola­
tility impact, respectively. The p values of a and b are all significant in
the 10% significance level. Parameter v stands for the joint distribution,
and all the p values of v are significant in the 10% significance level. We
applied the Engle and Sheppard method Engle and Granger (1987) to
confirm that the DCC holds a dynamic probability. Based on the p values
of the DCC probability, all the p values are less than 0.1, which can
significantly reject the null hypothesis that the DCC holds a constant

For the sake of brevity, we list these negative dynamic correlation periods in
the Appendix-C.

for cryptocurrency. Under this condition, cryptocurrency investors
could increase their transaction and speculation activities, which will
raise uncertainty in relevant markets [Akyildirim et al., 2020; Smales,
2022]. For example, during cryptocurrency flash event periods (e.g.,
Bitcoin value record high and Bitcoin transaction volume record high).
As a result, cryptocurrency markets experienced extreme volatility and
uncertainty, and these fluctuations can be conducted to the CBDCs. This
is also can explain why CBDCUI has a meaningful positive relationship
with the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Third, the reasons
CBDCAI sport a substantial association with the cryptocurrency mar­
ket’s volatility are similar to those with CBDCUI. From Fig. 4 and Fig. 10,
we can clearly observe that CBDCAI is occasionally dragged up by major
cryptocurrency events. For example, during Bitcoin’s one-year bull
market, Bitcoin hit a record-high $63503 while volumes recorded
1.26358E+11, among others. Moreover, CBDC is a well-known fiat
digital currency [Kirkby, 2018; Ferrari et al., 2022], which aims to be
’anti-cryptocurrency’ (Brunnermeier and Landau, 2022). Therefore, a
heated discussion on or intensive attention of CBDCs will trigger the
fluctuations in the cryptocurrency markets, same as the investor atten­
tion conduct mechanism in cryptocurrency market [Smales, 2022; Yan
et al., 2022]. Fourth, we also desire to explain why CBDC indices can
influence the volatility behind ICEA. This empirical finding is in line
with the existing literature concerning the environmental issues of the
CBDCs (Laboure et al., 2021). Importantly, although the central banks
launch CBDCs, they are still digital currencies. As such, CBDCs also will
consume energy and thus pollute the environment. ICEA is an index that
captures the cryptocurrency attention on environmental issues. There­
fore, CBDC indices and ICEA volatility showcase a meaningful correla­
tion with one another.
Now, we will explain why the CBDC indices have a significant

probability. The McLeod-Li test with 1 lag confirms no ARCH effects in
the residuals of the fitted DCC-GJR-GARCH (1,1) models (McLeod and
Li, 1983). All the p-values of the McLeod-Li (1) test results are greater
than 0.05, indicating that the null hypothesis of the McLeod-Li (1) test
cannot be rejected, and there are no ARCH effects among 1 lag to note in
the residuals of the fitted DCC-GJR-GARCH (1,1) models. The p values of
the Jarque-Bera and Ljung-Box tests with 1 lag for residuals of each
fitted DCC-GJR-GARCH (1,1) model are all greater than 0.05, which can
confirm that the residuals of each estimated model are normally
distributed with no autocorrelation in the squared residuals. Therefore,
all the fitted DCC-GJR-GARCH (1,1) models can successfully pass the
diagnostic tests, suggesting the correctness and robustness of the
models. Moreover, these diagnostic tests can prove the GJR-GARCH (1,
1) model can fit well to the estimated variables, and there is no need to
further apply the higher-order moments within the GJR model.
5.8. A comprehensive interpretation of empirical findings
To start, we want to discuss the potential reasons why CBDC indices
have a significant positive relationship with the volatility of crypto­
currency markets. It is clear that CBDCUI represents uncertainty, which
has conduction effects on financial markets (Cao et al., 2017), so one
variable’s uncertainty may cause such in other variables. Thus, there
exists a definite correlation between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies in
terms of uncertainty. Second, upon examining the high CBDCUI periods
in detail from Fig. 4 and Fig. 9, we find that the high CBDCUI values are
aroused by unfavourable news regarding CBDC or cryptocurrency flash
events. As we mentioned many times above, CBDCs can be viewed as
’cryptocurrency counters’ launched by central banks (Turrin, 2021).
Consequently, the negative news for CBDC results is an acceptable signal
23

positive relationship with the volatility of the foreign exchange markets.
First, one possible explanation is that the rise in CBDC uncertainty and
attention can motivate foreign exchange traders to reduce or increase
their net long positions due to the ’stablecoin’ characteristic of the
CBDCs [Copeland, 2020; Fantacci and Gobbi, 2021; Brunnermeier and
Landau, 2022], thus directly inducing fluctuations in the foreign ex­
change rate. Second, the essence of a CBDC is the fiat currency. With the
development of CBDCs, the public has access both to cash and digital
currency, which leads to increased supplies of both in general. The
supply influx may lead to inflation. Although Chen and Siklos (2022)
indicates that CBDCs need not produce higher inflation, this is only a
simulation result based on the historical behaviour of the velocity of
circulation. Undoubtedly, liquidity will increase by developing CBDCs,
but excess supply will cause disruptions and major inflation (Brunner­
meier and Landau, 2022). Under this circumstance, increasing one
country’s inflation rate will increase the volatility of its currency ex­
change rate. Moreover, because of a conduction effect, the same will
occur between one country’s currency exchange rate and that of other
currencies. Third, CBDCUI is an uncertainty index. High uncertainty
maybe can cause high volatility. Fourth, from Fig. 4 and Fig. 10, we can
see that excellent news about CBDCs spikes the high CBDC attention
value (e.g., the CBDCs’ new developments). As we mentioned, CBDCs
can increase the liquidity of currencies, which also means the cost of
currency circulation is reduced, and foreign exchange transactions will
become easier to perform. Therefore, the cost of the foreign exchange
speculation transactions will lower, and the foreign exchange specula­
tion activities will also increase, bringing more fluctuations to foreign
exchange markets. This is especially true for CNY due to the progress of
cross-border transactions involving e-CNY. The exchange rates of CNY
will definitely become more volatile.
Thirdly, we want to explain the relationships between CBDC and
uncertainty indices (i.e., VIX and USEPU). Moreover, we will further
elucidate on the inconsistency between the two sets of relationships. Our
empirical findings indicate CBDC indices have a significant positive
relationship with the volatility of VIX but conversely have a negative
one with that of USEPU. These findings are consistent with the views of
Larina and Akimov (2020), who believe that the CBDCs are conductive
to reducing systemic financial risk, and also reconfirm the notions that
CBDCs positively impact the consumer friendly (Larina and Akimov,
2020); financial stability [Zams et al., 2020; Copeland, 2020;
McLaughlin, 2021; Buckley et al., 2021]; welfare gains (Davoo­
dalhosseini, 2021); economic growth rate (Tong and Jiayou, 2021); the
ability of central bank’s to stabilise the business cycle (Barrdear and
Kumhof, 2021). First, one possible explanation behind the latter case
concerns the ’stablecoin’ characteristic of CBDCs because the substitu­
tion effect of the CBDCs on bank deposits is limited, and the overall
economic effect is positive. Second, based on our unconditional corre­
lation table Table 2 and the literature about USEPU and VIX, the USEPU
and the VIX should express a positive relationship. In fact, the re­
lationships between CBDC indices and USEPU, the relationships of CBDC
indices and VIX are inconsistent in this study. The potential explanations
could be that the VIX-EPU relationship is not always positive and is
time-variant, and USEPU and VIX are more coherent to the developed
market (i.e., France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom), which is
confirmed by (Tiwari et al., 2019). However, our CBDC indices boast
wider coverage (e.g., China, Russia, Swiss, Spain, Portugal, etc.), also
including some developing countries (e.g., Ukraine, Panama, Ecuador,
etc.). These points potentially can explain the inconsistencies in the
relationships between CBDC and uncertainty indices. Third, the likeliest
reason for the significant positive relationship between CBDC indices
and VIX is that the latter is related to the market’s expectations for the
volatility in the S&P 500 over the coming 30 transaction days, and the
S&P 500 contains 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the
USA. From the news our indices captured, we know that, although the
e-USD is being tested, the progress remains slow. China and its e-CNY
are leading in the CBDC (Turrin, 2021). The new progress of e-CNY can

spike both CBDCUI and CBDCAI. Moreover, many media, scholars and
investors believe that e-CNY is challenging the hegemony of the USD
and will supplant it as the most important currency used for interna­
tional settlements (Fantacci and Gobbi, 2021). This kind of viewpoint
will shake the confidence of US financial markets and cause panic in the
US stock market, especially for large companies with prominent inter­
national businesses.
Fourthly, we want to illustrate that why CBDC indices have a sig­
nificant positive relationship with the safe-haven, gold. This empirical
evidence confirms our concerns that CBDC may lead to inflation because
favourable CBDC news spike CBDC indices in general, and gold is a safe
haven against anti-inflation (Brunnermeier and Landau, 2022). First, a
widely discussed viewpoint now is that the CBDCs could serve as a
stablecoin, and it is preferable to hold CBDCs as a safe-haven instead of
the traditional safe-haven, gold in times of financial crisis [Copeland,
2020; Fantacci and Gobbi, 2021]. Second, with the increasing of CBDC
uncertainties, speculation transaction activities concerning gold as a
safe haven also will increase, thus causing gold price fluctuations. Third,
the significant positive relationship between CBDCAI and gold can be
similarly explained by the aforementioned gold speculation trans­
actions. If some investors value CBDCs from an analyst perspective, they
may also realise this phenomenon is a potential issue. They will increase
their net long positions in gold, thus directly inducing fluctuations in
gold prices.
Fifthly, CBDC indices have a significant negative impact on the
volatility of the MSCI World Bank Index. This empirical finding re­
confirms the notion of [Sissoko, 2020; Zams et al., 2020; Brunnermeier
and Landau, 2022] that CBDCs can balance the banking system, reduce
the shadow banking, and the magnitude of the disruption from the
CBDCs to banks business model is small, but different from [Yamaoka,
2019; Zams et al., 2020; Sinelnikova-Muryleva, 2020; Williamson, 2021;
Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2021; Viuela et al., 2020; Chen and Siklos,
2022], who believe that CBDCs can upset commercial banking, the
CBDCs may have significant negative consequences for the risk of
structural bank disintermediation and systemic bank runs, and the
central banks will become deposit monopolists by issuing CBDCs.
(Barrdear and Kumhof, 2021) also suggests the risks to banks can be
minimised through appropriate CBDCs issuance arrangements. The
operating system of CBDCs could contribute a lot to this phenomenon.
Currently, multiple countries have adopted the two-level operation
system of CBDCs. For example, the People’s Bank of China converts
e-CNY to the designated operating institutions such as commercial banks
or other commercial institutions and allows these institutions to convert
e-CNY to the public instead of directly issuing and converting CBDCs to
the public. The conversion of a CBDC adopts the conversion process of
1:1, which means commercial banks and other operating institutions
must pay the central bank the reserve fund of 100%. The two-level
operation system of CBDCs guarantees the reasonability of a CBDC is­
suances like the issuance of paper currencies, which will negatively in­
fluence the existing financial system and impact the real economy or
financial stability such as increasing inflation rate, competing for com­
mercial banks and traditional financial institutions and stimulating the
speculative transactions of the financial market. Digital Currency/E­
lectronic Payment (DC/EP) in China adopts the two-level operation
mode to guarantee the excess issuance of CBDCs. When the currency
production requirement meets verification rules, corresponding limit
vouchers will be sent, which will neither negatively influence the
inflation rate nor compete with the traditional business model of com­
mercial banks.
Sixth, we seek to uncover the significant negative relationships be­
tween the FTSE All-World Index and CBDC indices. The characteristic of
the CBDCs have the potential to promote financial stability can explain
this empirical phenomenon [Zams et al., 2020; Copeland, 2020;
McLaughlin, 2021; Buckley et al., 2021]. Moreover, this empirical proof
is consistent with [Zams et al., 2020; Tong and Jiayou, 2021; Barrdear
and Kumhof, 2021; Fantacci and Gobbi, 2021], who suggest that CBDCs
24

Y. Wang et al.

Technological Forecasting & Social Change 180 (2022) 121715

can improve financial inclusion, mitigate systemic financial risk and
raise GDP. In point three, we have demonstrated why the CBDC indices
have a significant positive relationship with the volatility of the VIX.
However, the FTSE All-World Index is also related to the stock market,
and its volatility shows a significantly negative relationship with CBDC
indices. To determine why the two stock market indices have adverse
reactions to the shocks from the CBDCs, we need to differentiate be­
tween the scopes of the VIX and the FTSE All-World Index. VIX focuses
on large companies in the U.S. financial market (Whaley, 2009), but the
FTSE All-World Index is an international stock market index that covers
over 3,100 companies in 47 countries. The markets represented by the
FTSE All-World Index and the VIX differ, resulting in their different
relationships with the CBDC indices.
Finally, CBDCUI and CBDCAI positively affect the FTSE World
Government Bond Index, which can be explained by the following two
points. First, CBDCs could cast doubt on the solvency of commercial
banks, reshape the international monetary system, and cause negative
interest rates (Brunnermeier and Landau, 2022). Moreover, this finding
echoes the latest study of (Ferrari et al., 2022), which indicates that a
CBDC issued by one country could increase asymmetries in the inter­
national monetary system by having negative consequences on mone­
tary policy autonomy and welfare in the other countries. These potential
characteristics of CBDCs may destabilise the financial system. The lower
the financial stability, the higher the volatility of bond markets, espe­
cially government bond markets (Acharya and Steffen, 2015). Second,
exchange rate mechanisms and exchange rate regimes also have a pos­
itive impact on the volatility of sovereign bond markets (Cappiello et al.,
2006). Since CBDC indices positively impact the exchange rate volatility
of EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD, RUB/USD and CNY/USD, they will
certainly bring a positive shock to the volatility of the FTSE World
Government Bond Index. Moreover, the positive relationships between
CBDC indices and bond markets volatility can also be interpreted as
public concern for CBDCs in the economy and society.

increases.
Or
H1 : CBDC indices risk increases, financial variables’ volatility
decreases.
To evaluate the significance of the relationship, we followed the
methodologies of [Pástor and Veronesi, 2013; Demir et al., 2018, Al
Mamun et al., 2020; Lang et al., 2021]. The regression model is as fol­
lows Equation21:
FVt = β1 + β2 CBDCt + β3 FVt− 1 + εt ,

(21)

where, FV denotes financial variable volatility, and CBDC denotes the
CBDC uncertainty risk or the CBDC attention risk, FVt− 1 is designed to
removing any serial correlation in FVt . ε is the error term.
We tested this hypothesis as a null hypothesis of when β2 > 0, in­
dicates that the volatility of financial variables increases under more
uncertainty or attention; when β2 < 0, indicates that the volatility of
financial variables increase when there is less uncertainty or attention.
First, FV and CBDC are still calculated by the continuously com­
pounded returns. The results are shown in Table 6 columns (1) and (2).
The results in columns (1) and (2) show the significance of the results
at the 10% level. The β2 values of the MSCI World Bank Index, USEPU,
and FTSE All-World Index in the CBDCUI and CBDCAI were less than
zero, thus implying that the volatility of these three financial variables
had a negative relationship with the CBDCUI and CBDCAI. In other
words, the volatility of the MSCI World Bank Index, USEPU, and the
FTSE All-World Index decrease in the face of greater CBDC uncertainty
or attention. The β2 values of the other financial variables (except for the
three just discussed) were greater than zero, thereby indicating a posi­
tive relationship between these financial variables and the CBDCUI or
CBDCAI. These additional results accord with our former empirical
analysis, thus proving our main findings’ robustness.
Second, while we still followed the formula of Equation21, we
calculated the FV and CBDC by the realised variance. For example,
denoting the nearby weekly variable value at time t as St , the realised
variance from time 1 to time T, denoted as RVt,T , can be computed as:
∑
RVt,T = T1 Ti=1 (rt+i − rt+i )2 , where rt+i = 100 × ln(St+i /St+i− 1 ) and rt+i =

5.9. Robustness test
As we sought to identify the effects of CBDC indices on financial
markets, we selected the SVAR and DCC-GJR-GARCH models as the two
econometrics models that would most effectively help us achieved our
research aim. In order to obtain a more rigorous conclusion, we
considered it necessary to design and process several robustness tests.
The core heart of the indices’ effects on financial markets with SVAR and
DCC-GJR-GARCH models is the relationships between the indices and
the financial variables. From our empirical analysis, we concluded that
both CBDC indices had a significantly negative relationship with the
MSCI World Bank Index, USEPU, and FTSE All-World Index. Moreover,
both CBDC indices had a significantly positive relationship with the
other financial variables. Therefore, our robustness tests could focus on
how to confirm these relationships between the CBDC indices and those
financial variables.
Due to the limitation of the data period, we only selected Bitcoin as a
proxy to represent the broader cryptocurrency market in the main
empirical analysis. In the robustness test, we consider including a more
comprehensive cryptocurrency proxy, CRIX (Trimborn and Härdle,
2018), to capture the cryptocurrency market. It allows close tracking of
the evolution of the diverse, very volatile, and frequently changing
cryptocurrency market with a small number of constituents (a minimum
of five cryptocurrency assets, which are verified as investable). We
collected the CRIX from S&P Global. CRIX is widely used as a broad
cryptocurrency market indicator to investigate the relationships be­
tween the cryptocurrency market and other financial markets [Klein
et al., 2018; Umar et al., 2021b; Yan et al., 2022].
In order to evaluate the reliability of the empirical results, we first
further analysed the relationship between CBDC indices risk and
financial variables’ volatility. Our hypothesis is as follows:
H1 : CBDC indices risk increases, financial variables’ volatility also

100 × ln(St+i /St+i− 1 ) are the one-period return and the average return
for T periods. The results are shown in Table 6 columns (3) and (4).
From the results in columns (3) and (4), although we calculated all of
the variables in a realised variance, the relationships between the
financial variables and the CBDC indices (which we demonstrated in the
former empirical analysis) still held in the Equation21. Moreover, the
MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and FTSE All-World Index showed a
statistically significant negative relationship with the CBDCUI or
CBDCAI at the 10% significance level. The statistically significant pos­
itive relationships between the other financial variables and CBDC
indices were also still at the 10% level. The results from this Equation21
further prove the robustness of our main empirical findings.
Secondly, the robustness test of our results can be confirmed using
the methodology of Whaley (2009). When CBDCt displayed a negative
relationship with FVt , we found that the changes in CBDCt rose at a
higher absolute rate when the FVt fell than when it increased. In other
words, when CBDCt showed a positive relationship with FVt , the changes
in CBDCt rise at a higher absolute rate when the FVt rises, than when the
FVt falls. The regression model is as follows Equation 22:
CBDCt = β1 + β2 FVt + β3 FVt− + εt ,

(22)

where CBDC and FV are still calculated by the continuously com­
pounded return and represent the rate of change of the CBDCUI,
CBDCAI, and financial variables. FV − denotes the rate of change of the
financial variables conditional on the market going down, and zero
otherwise. ε is the error term.
First, if CBDC has a positive relationship with FV, both of the slope
coefficients of FV and FV − would have to be greater than zero. The
25

Y. Wang et al.

Technological Forecasting & Social Change 180 (2022) 121715

second condition is that the slope coefficient of FV is more significant
than zero, and the slope coefficient of FV − less than, but the coefficient
value of FV would be greater than that of FV − . If CBDC has a negative
relationship with FV, both of the slope coefficients of FV and FV − should
be less than zero.
The results are shown in Table 6 columns (5) and (6). The results of
the robustness test confirmed our empirical results reported earlier.
Moreover, the results allow us to clearly observe that the CBDCUI and
CBDCAI have a statistically significant and negative relationship with
the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and FTSE All-World Index.
Additionally, the CBDCUI and CBDCAI have a statistically significant
and positive relationship with the other variables. For example, if the
USEPU rises by 100 basis points, the CBDCUI will fall by: CBDCUIt = −
0.000, 2 × (0.01) = − 0.000, 2%, and if the USEPU falls by 100 basis
points, the CBDCUI will rise by: CBDCUIt = − 0.000, 2 × ( − 0.01) −
0.002, 5( − 0.01) = 0.000, 002 + 0.000, 025 = 0.000, 027 = 0.0027%.
In the end, the statistical results regarding effects of the CBDC indices
on the CRIX from column (1) to column (7) show that the CBDCUI and
CBDCAI have a statistically significant and positive relationship with the
CRIX, which indicates that the CBDCUI and CBDCAI can have a positive
impact on the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, this finding can further
confirm the positive relationship between the CBDC indices and Bitcoin,
which has been proved above.

to financial areas. This methodology can provide a new channel to more
comprehensively understand broad financial developments by system­
atic online empirical inquiries.
While early research suggests that Bitcoin is by far the most influ­
ential cryptocurrency [Corbet et al., 2020a; Ma et al., 2020], the most
recent evidence indicates that crypto-assets can be categorised as
decentralised applications (dapps) and protocols [Huynh et al., 2020;
Chang et al., 2020], and have become more attractive for investors than
’pure’ cryptocurrencies (White et al., 2020). This displays a shift in
consumer and investor preferences from pioneer cryptocurrency to­
wards more innovative, scalable, and versatile digital payment in­
struments and assets (Umar et al., 2021a). Thus, CBDC may become a
competitive product for investors and cryptocurrency users, thereby
bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional markets for
widespread use.
We believe it pertinent to mention several research pathways for
future investigation. As another innovation of a central bank’s financial
system, CBDCs are aimed at the digitisation, decentration, and disin­
termediation of sovereign currency. From a global monetary perspec­
tive, applying these (central bank-endorsed) digital currencies is a new
step towards modern society’s digital transformation. As CBDCs
continue progressing, the functions of sovereign currency will be
enriched, and sovereign currency will be endowed with such new
functions as value storage and measurement, and free convertibility
instead of a single payment tool. As society increasingly accepts CBDCs,
the global financial system will be changed dramatically and inevitably
in multiple aspects, such as daily individual payment modes, the pay­
ment system of society as a whole, the structure of the commercial
banking system, and even the operation of the capital market. Countries
assuming the leading role regarding CBDCs can maintain effective
competitive advantages during the digitisation of global currencies.
While promoting the internationalisation of sovereign currency, CBDCs
can improve the financial software power of various countries. In China
especially, the RMB has been castigated due to its failure to freely
circulate and be converted in the international market. As the progress
of digital-RMB is pushed forward, the currency will operate more
competitively at the levels of international or reserve currency. We thus
expect to see significant local and international impacts of CBDCs on
competition in the payments and fintech sector.
The role of CBDCs in the monetary system, its actual economic
performance, and society’s acceptance of it remain to be tested and
observed. Therefore, CBDCs’ problems require further investigation.
First, we can further analyse the CBDCAI and CBDCUI with firm-level
data. For example, we can investigate if our CBDC indices are associ­
ated with greater stock price volatility, poor financial statement per­
formances in the financial services sector, or other policy-sensitive
sectors, such as energy, technology, and real estate. Second, due to
constraints regarding the scope of this paper, future studies could
examine the effects of CBDCUI and CBDCAI on cryptocurrencies in
greater detail. Considering the issue of the data period length, we did not
include composite cryptocurrency indices into the main variable system.
However, it would be interesting to also investigate the interconnections
between the CBDC indices and the CRIX or BGCI by using the VAR, DCCGARCH or VAR spillover connectedness model. Besides, the predicted
powers of CBDC indices can also be further developed. Third, it is worth
understanding that cryptocurrencies can have a partial effect between
CBDC indices and financial markets or the partial effects of CBDC indices
on USEPU and VIX. Fourth, the construction of infrastructures sup­
porting the progress of CBDCs, issuance and market supervision of
CBDCs, and compliance and supervision of the financial institutions
responsible should be explored further. Focusing on individual users is
another potential research direction. What actual effects, advantages,
and disadvantages will a CBDC be able to provide a country’s different
users? When other digital payment modes still occupy a large market
share, can various governments’ CBDCs research and efforts expect
returns?

6. Conclusions
This paper assesses the impact of CBDC news on financial markets
using the over 660m news items collected from LexisNexis News &
Business database. Specifically, we introduce two new measures of un­
certainty and attention for CBDCs that can be used by cryptocurrency
researchers, investors, and financial regulators in their subsequent work.
Our new CBDC Uncertainty Index and the CBDC Attention Index
have been constructed and made available for the period from January
2015 to June 2021. We employ of empirical test to examine the
behaviour of CBDC indexes in relation to cryptocurrency markets (i.e.
UCRY indices, ICEA and Bitcoin), other popular uncertainty measures (i.
e. VIX and USEPU), stock markets (i.e. FTSE All-World Index), banking
sectors (i.e. MSCI World Bank Index), bond markets (i.e. FTSE World
Government Bond Index), exchange rates (i.e. EUR/USD, GBP/USD,
RUB/USD, JPY/USD, and CNY/USD) and gold during this period and
capture the dynamics of these interrelationships.
Our empirical results suggest that CBDC indices have a significantly
negative effect on the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index,
USEPU, and FTSE All-World Index. However, CBDC indices have a
significantly positive effect on the volatilities of UCRY Policy, UCRY
Price, ICEA, and Bitcoin (cryptocurrency markets), FTSE World Gov­
ernment Bond Index (bond markets), EUR/USD, GBP/USD, RUB/USD,
JPY/USD, and CNY/USD (foreign exchange markets), as well as VIX and
gold. Furthermore, the volatilities of financial variables are more sen­
sitive to CBDCUI when compared with reactions from CBDCAI shocks,
highlighting the importance of CBDC uncertainty in this interconnected
system. The HD results suggest that both cumulative positive and
negative effects of CBDCUI’s disturbances on financial variables are
larger than those of CBDCAI disturbances. These results display that
uncertainty around CBDC news plays more important role that just an
attention to this new digital assets, which suggest that introduction of
CBDC can bring significant changes to the economy. Our results show
that good news and positive government policies can significantly
negatively affect the CBDCUI HD results, by decreasing the uncertainty
around these assets. However, the HD results for both the CBDCUI and
CBDCAI show significant spikes near key CBDC innovations and
important digital currency events. The results of the robustness test
demonstrate the reliability and validity of our empirical findings.
In terms of methodology, our paper further contributes to the liter­
ature by showcasing how to make the most effective use of internet
literature database archives to develop and issue new indices of interest

There is plenty of room for the development of CBDC in various
countries, and there remains much progress to be made. However,
digital currency is reshaping our payment system, payment modes, and
new financial order. CBDC must be the main battlefield of various
countries in the field of fintech. Besides, as money never sleeps, further
research into the roles and advantages of CBDCs can only be beneficial.
