Abstract
This research investigated perceived risks associated with central bank digital currency (CBDC) payment innovations
and their effect on travelers’ adoption behavior, considering personal and product characteristics. This quantitative
study determined that perceived risks, including financial, performance, privacy, psychological, and time risks, have an
adverse effect on attitudes toward CBDC payment, which, in turn, affects the intention to adopt. In addition, this study
underlined the moderating roles of consumer innovativeness, previous experience, structural assurance, and media
encouragement in the link between perceived risk and attitude. The results advanced the understanding of travelers’
intention to use CBDC to pay for tourism products and services.

Introduction
A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is predicted to be a
paradigm-shifting medium in the global financial system
(Wang & Gao, 2021). Approximately 110 countries in the
world are at some stage of CBDC development (Okuwoga,
2021), and central banks are considering issuing CBDC
instead of using cash and making it competitive against other
means of transaction, such as cryptocurrency (Gross et al.,
2021). The major benefits of using CBDC include safety,
speed, stability and reliability, and ease of use (Bindseil,
2019; Radic et al., 2022). Shkliar (2020) found that favorable
factors for the implementation of CBDC include more efficient retail payments, improved financial stability, strengthened the effectiveness of monetary policy, and reduced cash
payments. The role of CBDC payments is substantial in the
tourism industry, which involves significant numbers of individual cross-border online payments (Radic et al., 2022).
Innovations are generally welcomed as they can add additional value. The acceptance of new products and services is
commonly stimulated by various factors. Some are related to

the individual themselves, and others involve product-related
forces. Individuals’ decision-making on whether they will
embrace novel offerings or not is affected by their own characteristics, which include personality traits, knowledge level,
and involvement (Han et al., 2019; Straub, 2009).
In the domain of technology acceptance, consumer innovativeness and previous experience have been frequently validated as influencing factors; people with a greater degree of
innovativeness and with relevant experience are more likely to
exhibit approach behavior (Aldás-Manzano et al., 2009; Kaur
& Arora, 2020; Z. Zhang & Hou, 2017). People also commonly rely on the characteristics of the product itself, which
include relative advantage and reputation during the introduction of novel offerings (Choe et al., 2021; Zolkepli &
Kamarulzaman, 2015). Specifically, additional value associated with a new product, such as structural assurance, and
external sources of product evaluation, such as media encouragement, play an essential role in consumers’ acceptance decisions (Filotto et al., 2021; Zolait & Sulaiman, 2009).
However, people may also perceive risks associated with
innovative offerings (Han et al., 2019). The current body of

literature on payment innovation illustrates the ongoing interest
in using the concept of perceived risks to predict negative
responses, such as hesitation and resistance (Chauhan et al.,
2019; Wu et al., 2022). Perceived risk is defined as the diverse
probable and potential losses that consumers perceive pertaining to purchase choice of a product or service (Jacoby & Kaplan,
1972). In the online shopping context, Forsythe and Shi (2003)
described perceived risk as consumers’ subjective expectation
about loss: an inner experience, by individuals, which cannot be
observed directly. According to Bauer (1960), perceived risk is
a multidimensional construct, which encompasses financial,
performance, privacy, psychological, and time risks. The theory
of perceived risk helps to explain consumers’ avoidance behavior and the significance of each facet of perceived risk in forming consumer behavior (Ariffin et al., 2018; Choe et al., 2021).
This study focused on customers’ responses to CBDC payment in the tourism field. A thorough literature review indicated several research gaps. First, there has been an increasing
number of studies on customers’ responses to mobile payment in the tourism literature (Han et al., 2021; S. Park &
Tussyadiah, 2017; Quan et al., 2023). Recently, CBDC payment has been recognized as a payment tool for cross-border
and person-to-person transactions worldwide, such as remittances and international e-commerce (Auer & Böhme, 2020;
Gross et al., 2021; World Bank, 2021). However, very few
studies are available concerning customers’ intention to adopt
CBDC payments in the tourism sector because this payment
system is so new (J. J. Kim et al., 2022; Radic et al., 2022).
Second, it has been found that various perceived risks
have an adverse effect on people’s attitudes toward technological innovations, which in turn affects the intention to
adopt (Han et al., 2019; Hwang, Kim, Kim, et al., 2021).
However, the effect of risk perceptions associated with digital forms of money—in this case CBDC payments—on attitude has not been actively explored because CBDC payment
is an emergent issue in the international tourism context.
Third, previous studies pertaining to CBDC payment
innovations have not dealt with the impacts of personal and
product characteristics in understanding tourists’ adoption
intentions. Therefore, the present study analyzes the moderating effects of personal and product characteristics in a
model incorporating consumer innovativeness, previous
experiences, structural assurance, and media encouragement.
These diverse factors have not been used in previous studies
in the context of tourism and hospitality.
To reduce the research gaps, the rationale for this research
was to develop theoretical insights by exploring barriers and
providing empirical evidence of the impact of perceived
risks in the formation of consumer adoption behavior toward
CBDC payments. In summary, the current study was
designed to investigate the way forward in removing barriers, from a customer’s perspective, to the uptake of CBDC
payment innovations in the tourism industry. The study
examines the multidimensional perceived risks associated
with CBDC payment and their role in shaping attitude, which
in turn affects willingness to adopt CBDC payment systems.

In addition, the roles of personal characteristics and product
characteristics are considered in the relationship between
perceived risk and attitude toward CBDC payment.
The current research had the following four objectives: (1)
to explore the effects of multi-dimensional perceived risks
(i.e., financial, performance, privacy, psychological, and time
risks) on tourists’ attitudes toward CBDC payment; (2) to
evaluate the relationship between tourists’ attitude and their
intention to adopt CBDC payment; (3) to assess the moderating role of personal characteristics in the link between perceived risk and travelers’ attitude toward CBDC payment;
and (4) to identify the moderating effect of product characteristics in the link between perceived risk and tourists’ attitudes
toward CBDC payment systems. The findings lead to possible recommendations with regard to the implementation of
CBDC payment innovations in the tourism industry.

Literature Review
Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Payment
and Perceived Risk
Since money represents value, it is used as an essential means
of transaction and functions as an economic system (Kydland,
1989). In human history, transactions began with barter, that
is, the exchange of goods or services for other goods or services, such as food, gold, silver, copper, or paper notes.
Financial transactions have now developed to involve electronic and digital systems such as online debit/credit card
payment, electronic cash or checks, and internet banking
(Davies et al., 2010; Peluso, 2021). The use of the internet has
accelerated extensions to financial systems, for example, the
replacement of money with virtual currency, and other transaction products such as cryptocurrency and stablecoins (Shen
& Hou, 2021). Finally, the most pervasive currency, known as
Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), has been realized.
The use of these payment systems has been slowly increasing in developing countries and has become the foundation of
futuristic financial transactions (Ligon et al., 2019). The preference for the fast transfer of emergency payments during
COVID-19 has increased the demand for digital payment
methods (Rennie & Steele, 2021). However, research in India
found that the adoption level of digital payment systems is still
low due to various factors, particularly demand-side factors,
which include increasing tax liability records of mobile payments and customers’ low trust levels for digital payments
(Ligon et al., 2019).
Very recently, the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) have considered implementing the
direct exchange of CBDC (BIS et al., 2021). In a situation in
which governments are debating the adoption of CBDC due to
the complexity of the system (He et al., 2022), China has a keen
interest in international governance of the CBDC payment system because its popularity could be used to forestall the preemptive position of the U.S. dollar as a world currency (Wang,
2022). However, the adoption of the system can be influenced

Kim et al.
by numerous factors, such as transparency of transactions, protection of privacy, domestic political situations, legal and regulatory support, and customers’ trust in the economic system.
As a theoretical foundation, the current study focuses on
customers’ perceived risk associated with tourists’ intention to
adopt CBDC. The customer’s expectation of loss or a mismatch between the expected and actually purchased product/
service is an axis of perceived risk theory (Bauer, 1960;
Mitchell, 1992, 1999). This theory has attracted the attention of
researchers and marketing practitioners for its versatility and
applicability in different research contexts. The vital concept of
this theory is that a consumer’s primary goal is to minimize
anticipated risks rather than to maximize the expected utility
from purchased services/products (Chang & Chen, 2014). In
the context of electronic payment systems, the psychological
risk dimension occurs when a specific payment method induces
psychological anxiety or irritation (Ho & Ng, 1994). It also
occurs when customers perceive when purchasing that they did
not really want an item or made the wrong purchase. Ariffin
et al. (2018) found that psychological risk significantly and
negatively influenced consumers’ online purchase intention
because consumers are concerned about security risks.
Based on perceived risk theory, this study uses the perceived risk dimensions proposed by Littler and Melanthiou
(2006) in the internet banking context. This study considers
perceived risk to involve financial, performance, privacy,
social, time, and psychological risks and examines their
influences on customers’ attitudes toward CBDC payment.
In a CBDC transaction situation, the concept of perceived
risk is essential in analyzing consumer behavior, which is
affected by concerns relating to undesirable consequences,
primarily in online transaction situations (Bindseil, 2019;
Koziuk & Ivashuk, 2022; Okuwoga, 2021).

Relationship Between Perceived Risk and Attitude
Toward CBDC Payment
Internet banking institutions require stricter security compared to other industries since financial services deal with
personal and financial risk issues (Baker et al., 2011). Ho and
Ng (1994) conceptualized five perceived risk dimensions
pertinent to electronic payment systems: performance, time
loss, psychological, physical, and financial. Since financial
risk refers to consumers’ concerns about the security of internet banking transactions, it is a suitable variable with which
to examine consumers’ attitudes to the CBDC payment system (Roy et al., 2017).
S. Park and Tussyadiah (2017) developed a multidimensional instrument for assessing perceived risk in the mobile
travel booking context, in which the dimensions of perceived
risk included performance, time, privacy/security, financial,
physical, psychological, and device risks. Lee (2009), in contrast, studied the perceived risk of internet banking adoption
and divided the perceived risk dimensions into time, performance, financial, social, and security risks. Five dimensions
of risk were used by Shuhidan et al. (2017) in the mobile

3
banking context. According to Zhao et al. (2008), in Chinese
internet banking services adoption, only four perceived risk
dimensions, including privacy, security, finance, and performance risks, were considered. In the context of retail banking
services, other researchers have assumed that perceived risk
encompasses financial, performance, time, psychological,
and security risks (Featherman & Pavlou, 2003; Littler &
Melanthiou, 2006). In general, the number and types of
dimensions may vary based on the context of risk occurrences. For example, Han et al. (2019) dealt with the perceived risk associated with electric airplanes, encompassing
performance risk, physical risk, psychological risk, and financial risk. Choe et al. (2021) found that performance risk and
psychological risk constituted the perceived risk relating to
drone-based delivery services in terms of evaluating the
image of such services. The existing literature implies that the
significance of each facet of perceived risk differs depending
on the field. This indicates that examining the multidimensional perceived risk in CBDC payment is a necessity.
This study adopted a multidimensional structure for perceived risk in the context of CBDC payments that tourists
may use during travel. The first risk dimension, financial risk
in internet banking, is involved with concerns about financial
loss as a result of providing wrong specifications for account
numbers, legal issues triggered by a user’s incorrect transfer,
exposure of personal account details, and scamming
(Hanafizadeh & Khedmatgozar, 2012). Radic et al. (2022)
noted that customers’ use of CBDC requires the removal of
perceived potential financial risks. Tong and Jiayou (2021)
elaborated that CBDC is vulnerable to financial risks related
to nonbank financial intermediation and issuance of currency. The negative relationship between perceived financial
risk and attitude toward internet banking systems is supported by previous studies (Hong et al., 2016; Zou, 2021).
Therefore, perceived financial risk-generating factors can
increase negative views about using CBDC payments.
As the second dimension, performance risk can occur when
a specific payment is inadequate to complete a transaction
because of additional charges, failure to access an account, or
rejection by the bank (Ariffin et al., 2018; Ho & Ng, 1994). In
the context of internet banking, performance risk relates to
inefficient internet banking transaction processes (Roy et al.,
2017). As addressed by Hanafizadeh and Khedmatgozar
(2012), the efficiency of internet banking is determined by factors including inefficient access and internet operation, and
low performance of internet banking compared to its advertised capabilities. Wu et al. (2022) empirically investigated
consumers’ intention to adopt digital currency electronic payment in China and found that perceived risk significantly and
negatively influenced consumers’ intention to use digital currency. Interestingly, national identity and sense of belongingness were found to be significant moderators of the relationship
between perceived risk and usage intention. Likewise,
Chauhan et al. (2019) found that perceived security risk significantly and negatively determined consumers’ intention to
adopt digital payment methods in internet banking.

As the third dimension, privacy in the internet banking
security context refers to customers’ confidentiality and their
ability to offer the right personal information at the required
time (Ouaddah et al., 2016). Accordingly, the privacy risk in
online banking or transactions arises from the disclosure of
consumers’ personal information during internet banking,
and at the time of providing private data to internet banking
facilities, and misuse of these private data by the bank
(Hanafizadeh & Khedmatgozar, 2012; Roy et al., 2017). The
protection of privacy is more complex in the case of digital
currency because it requires commitment from agents to
secure customers’ privacy or anonymity (Koziuk & Ivashuk,
2022). Rennie and Steele (2021) defined four types of privacy risks pertinent to CBDC models, including loss of anonymity, loss of liberty, loss of individual control, and loss of
regulatory control. Similarly, Tronnier and Biker (2022)
noted that privacy concerns stem from customers’ past experiences, demographic characteristics, awareness about privacy practices, lack of trust, and personal beliefs.
Finally, the time risk dimension refers to consumers’ perception of the probability of wasted time, effort, and convenience when a product is wrongly purchased, mended, or
replaced (Ko et al., 2004; Masoud, 2013). Considering internet
banking services, Hanafizadeh and Khedmatgozar (2012)
described time risk as the consumer’s perception of the time
spent learning how to use internet banking, solving the problems relevant to internet banking, and implementing transactions in internet banking. Ariffin et al. (2018) found that time
risk was a significant predictor of consumers’ intention to use
online purchasing. Hanafizadeh and Khedmatgozar (2012)
identified time risk as the mediating variable in the relationship
between the consumer’s internet banking awareness and their
intention to adopt internet banking. In a similar vein, Husain’s
(2011) study noted that perceived risk related to time loss may
be higher for internet banking services. To the best of our
knowledge, there is no research that has examined the effects of
perceived risk on tourists’ attitudes toward CBDC payment. To
answer this question, the following hypothesis was postulated:
H1: The five dimensions of perceived risk negatively
affect attitude toward CBDC payment.

Relationship Between Attitude Toward CBDC
Payment and Intention to Adopt CBDC Payment
A number of prior studies have widely applied the technology acceptance model (TAM) in diverse technology contexts, including online shopping (Ghani et al., 2022;
Kesharwani and Bisht, 2012; Rose & Fogarty, 2006), smartphones (Özbek et al., 2014), and robotics (Go et al., 2020;
Lee et al., 2018). This model was adopted to assess perceived
ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention to
use. For instance, based on the TAM, Kesharwani and Bisht
(2012) showed that perceived risk negatively influences the
consumers’ intention to adopt internet banking. Lee et al.
(2018) also revealed that attitude toward robot technology

positively affected the technology acceptance of the users
with perceived usefulness, while perceived ease of use positively influenced perceived usefulness and attitude toward
robot technology. However, the TAM has not been widely
tested in the context of CBDC payment.
Recently, fintech has enhanced the convergence of CBDC
with the global financial network (GFN) and contributed to
alleviating strict regulations on financial sectors that hinder
internetization (Wang & Gao, 2021). Some studies (Boar
et al., 2020; Shkliar, 2020) have asserted that since the central
banks are keen on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency,
CBDC payment systems will gain popularity in tourism and
hospitality businesses. The relationship between attitude
toward a certain technology and behavioral intention has been
found to be positive when using online travel agencies (Ponte
et al., 2015), online banking (Kaur & Arora, 2020; Martins
et al., 2014), and mobile banking (G. Kim et al., 2009).
Furthermore, Zhu et al.’s (2012) findings indicated that
consumers’ attitude toward online games has a positive correlation with their intention to use computer games on the
internet. With regard to smartphone chatbot adoption for
shopping, the intention to use the technology was influenced
by customers’ attitudes toward chatbots (Kasilingam, 2020).
Similarly, a study that focused on the use of mobile devices
for private clubs showed that attitude influenced the intentions of club members to adopt a mobile device (Morosan &
DeFranco, 2014). Scholars have repeatedly found significant
relationships between attitude and behavioral intentions
toward technological innovations in the hospitality and tourism sectors (Han et al., 2019; Hwang, Kim, Kim, et al.,
2021). Therefore, those who have a favorable attitude toward
CBDC payment will demonstrate a high level of intention to
adopt CBDC payments. On this basis, the following hypothesis was proposed:
H2: Attitude toward CBDC payment positively affects
intention to adopt CBDC payment.

Moderating Effects
The present study identified other factors and tested their
moderating role in the adoption of the CBDC payment system. The factors used in this study are related to consumers’
personal characteristics (innovativeness and previous experience) and product characteristics (structural assurance and
media encouragement). The present study investigated the
effects of these characteristics on the relationship between
perceived risk and attitude toward the use of central banking
digital currencies, because consumers’ purchasing of new
products is influenced by both internal factors (personal
attributes) and external factors (product-related factors;
Turkyilmaz et al., 2015). Considering the circumstances or
situations in which the individuals or products exist helps
with understanding the potential buying behavior of consumers in CBDC transactions (Peluso, 2021; Radic et al., 2022;
Shkliar, 2020).

Kim et al.

Moderating Role of Personal Characteristics
(Consumer Innovativeness and Previous
Experience)
Individual innovativeness has been defined as an individual’s propensity to accommodate new knowledge and make
an independent decision without others’ influence (Midgley
& Dowling, 1978; F. Zhang et al., 2020). Jeong et al. (2017)
found that consumer innovativeness influenced consumers’
perceived novelty regarding wearable technologies. Z. Zhang
and Hou (2017) found that innate consumer innovativeness
moderated the relationship between perceived risk and intention to purchase innovative products. Consumer innovativeness was also considered a pervasive factor, which moderated
the relationship between the antecedents for using mobile
commerce and consumers’ intention to use mobile commerce
technology (Anwar et al., 2021). Hirunyawipada and Paswan
(2006) noted that consumer innovativeness strengthened
intentions to use new products, and Aldás-Manzano et al.
(2009) found that consumer innovativeness was a major predictor of intention to adopt electronic banking. These results
help to promote the positive role of consumer innovativeness
in dealing with perceived risks (privacy, security, social,
time, performance risks). Chauhan et al. (2019) also showed
that consumer innovativeness significantly and positively
influenced the intention to adopt internet banking services.
CBDC, as a cashless transaction, influences unbanked
consumers’ involvement in finance systems (Seth, 2022).
Those who aspire to adopt this novel technology are likely to
reveal positive attitudes toward it, even though they perceive
diverse risks stemming from using that technology. Hence,
the following hypothesis was posited:
H3: Consumer innovativeness significantly moderates the
impact of perceived risk on attitude toward CBDC
payment.
Another underpinning variable that may help to allay the
effects of perceived risk is past experience. According to
Kaur and Arora (2020), past experience was conducive to
fostering customers’ ability to decide independently, while
those who did not have past experience demanded approval
or support from others in order to decide. Taylor and Todd
(1995) empirically confirmed that there is a strong relationship between the intention to adopt technology and past
experience. Similarly, John (2013) confirmed that an individual’s past experience had a positive effect on self-efficacy
and intention to use social networking programs. Straub’s
(2009) findings indicated that personal characteristics such
as age, gender, and prior experience influenced technology
adoption. Lu et al. (2011) also found that customers’ previous experience with internet payment technology positively
affected their perceptions of payment services.
Kaur and Arora (2020) established that prior experience
was a moderator between perceived risk in using online
banking and consumers’ intention to adopt internet banking.

5
In exploring consumers’ intention to use mobile technology,
trust and previous experience with internet use moderated
the relationship between perceptions of utilitarian and
hedonic values in mobile technology and their intention to
adopt the technologies (J. Park and Yang, 2006). Previous
experience is thus likely to act as a moderator in the relationship between perceived risks and attitude toward CBDC payment. As a result, the following hypothesis was postulated to
test the relationship between the related variables:
H4: Previous experience significantly moderates the impact
of perceived risk on attitude toward CBDC payment.

Moderating Role of Product Characteristics
(Structural Assurance and Media
Encouragement)
McKnight et al. (2002) indicated that trust enables consumers to reduce perceived risk and insecurity. In an initial trust
formation stage, institutional-based trust nurtures an individual’s feeling of security through safety nets and guarantees or other conditions (McKnight et al., 1998; Shapiro,
1987; Zui et al., 2022). As conceptualized by McKnight et al.
(1998), institution-based trust has two dimensions: structural
assurance belief and situational normality belief. Structural
assurance refers to a belief that regulations, promises, guarantees, and contracts lead to success (Shapiro, 1987; Zucker,
1986). Filotto et al. (2021) found that structural assurance
played a decisive role in whether customers adopted online
banking. G. Kim et al. (2009) also observed that structural
assurance significantly influenced customers’ trust in and
favorability toward mobile banking. Zhou (2011) noted that
structural assurance helped customers be more confident in
their mobile banking payments and strengthened trust in the
system. In summary, structural assurance is likely to serve a
moderating role in the relationship between consumers’ perceived risk and attitudes toward CBDC payment. Consequently,
the following hypothesis was proposed:
H5: Structural assurance significantly moderates the
impact of perceived risk on attitude toward CBDC
payment.
Those who initially adopt a technology tend to display
confidence in seeking new technology and avoid perceived
risk by seeking interpersonal communication channels, participating in social events, and acquiring information
(Rogers, 1995). Zolait and Sulaiman (2009) found that word
of mouth and exposure to mass media had a significant effect
on Yemeni consumers’ acceptance of internet banking,
because mass media coverage helped in allaying consumers’
perceived risks. Likewise, YenYuen and Yeow (2008) found
that there was a positive relationship between mass media
opinion and consumers’ adoption of internet banking, with
customers noting that mass media helped enhance the credibility of the system and alleviate perceived risk. Recently,

6

Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)

Radic et al. (2022) ascertained that mass media contributed
to creating positive attitudes in tourists to the adoption of
digital currencies, because consumers believed that the content in mass media helped enhance the comprehensiveness of
digital currencies and dissipate distrust.
However, there is no study that has empirically explored the
moderating role of media encouragement in predicting the relationship between perceived risks and attitude toward CBDC
payment. Thus, the following hypothesis was proposed:
H6: Media encouragement significantly moderates the
impact of perceived risk on attitude toward CBDC
payment.
A conceptual framework including relevant constructs
and hypotheses was developed as shown in Figure 1.
Perceived risk was conceptualized as encompassing five
domains. It was hypothesized that the perceived risk affects
attitude toward CBDC payment, which determines the
intention to adopt CBDC payment. Four moderating variables are situated between perceived risk and attitude
toward CBDC payment.

Methodology
Measurement Development
The measurements for all study variables were adapted from
previous studies and were adjusted to the context of CBDC
payment innovation. The measurement items for multidimensional perceived risk were developed from previous
studies (Chen, 2013; Choe et al., 2021; Han et al., 2019;
Martins et al., 2014). Each of the three items for the varieties
of perceived risk was measured using a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). To
adopt Han et al.’s (2020) study, we used four measurements
for attitude with bipolar semantic-differential scales (i.e.,
“Negative” [1]–“Positive” [7]). Another four measurements
using a Likert-type scale were devised based on the studies
conducted by Ajzen (1991) and M. Kim (2021) in order to
assess the intention to adopt CBDC payment.
In addition, measurement items for moderating variables,
which were consumer innovativeness, structural assurance,
and media encouragement, were established based on a
7-point Likert scale. The four questionnaires were developed
to assess consumers’ general innovativeness on the basis of
earlier studies (e.g., Goldsmith & Hofacker, 1991; Hwang,
Kim, & Lee, 2021; Z. Zhang & Hou, 2017). The survey
included questions related to the extent to which respondents
tended to accept novel offerings sooner than other people
and the degree to which they were willing to adopt new products and services. With regard to structural assurance, we
created the following four items according to Delgosha and
Hajiheydari’s (2021) study: (1) “I would feel okay using
CBDC because it is backed up by a monetary authority (central bank)”; (2) “Monetary stability would make me feel all

right about using CBDC”; (3) “Favorable-to-consumer centralized structures would help me feel safe using CBDC”;
and (4) “Having the backing of a central bank would make
me feel secure in using CBDC.” Also, we developed two
items for media encouragement from Juschten et al.’s (2019)
study. These items were formulated to estimate how individuals perceive media coverage in promoting a positive image
of CBDC payment and how they are motivated to use CBDC
by such media coverage. To assess previous experience, we
used a nominal scale (Yes or No) to answer the question,
“Have you ever held cryptocurrency or virtual currency and
used these for buying products/services?” Overall, we used
various scales in order to estimate study constructs, which
helped reduce common method bias.

Survey Design
The survey was structured as follows. The first section contained the purpose of the study and the screening questions.
Two questions were used to restrict the survey to participants
who were aware of the emergence of CBDC and who had
often purchased products/services relating to the tourism
industry. Participants were asked to answer yes or no to the
question of whether they had heard about central bank digital
currency, and those who answered yes were eligible to participate in the survey. Also, they were asked to indicate the
frequency of purchasing tourism products based on the question “How often do you consume tourism products (e.g.,
hotel, tourism package purchase, airline, cruise, car rental)
on average?” and only those who confirmed frequent buying
experiences were permitted to complete the survey. The second part of the survey began with detailed information about
CBDC, which also emphasized its legal tender status as
declared by the government. Thus, participants became more
knowledgeable about the subject and understood how it is
distinguished from cryptocurrency. Multiple questions then
followed in order to assess the multidimensional perceived
risks associated with CBDC payments. Also, participants
were asked to respond to questions that had been developed
to measure attitudes toward CBDC payment, intention to
adopt CBDC payment, and four moderating constructs. The
last section included questions to identify the demographic
characteristics of the survey participants.
The survey was initially developed in English and subsequently translated into Chinese and Korean. We then hired
multiple academics who were native Korean and Chinese
speakers and asked them to review the questionnaire document to ensure there were no grammatical errors. We also
invited scholars in tourism departments and frequent international travelers to complete a pretest of the survey, and the
questions were fine-tuned to improve clarity.

ranked in the top 10. These two countries are also known as
innovative nations, which implies that people living in these
countries have significant knowledge of payment innovations. Thus, Chinese and South Koreans were determined to
be suitable survey targets, and we arranged online data collection with help from research companies in these respective countries. Both companies are known to have a
substantial number of panels, and they use several tools, such
as an incentive program, in order to obtain genuine responses
from participants. The survey yielded a total of 820 responses,
which included data from 397 Chinese and 423 Koreans,
over 3 weeks in September 2021. Of these, we identified 25
multivariate outliers using the Mahalanobis distance, which
is known as a useful multivariate distance metric. As a result,
795 responses were retained and used for the data analysis.

Analytical Technique
Following a two-step approach (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988),
the measurement model was initially assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and then the research hypotheses were examined using structural equation modeling
(SEM). A metric invariance test allows researchers to substantiate multigroup comparisons of factor variances and
covariances, and it is often adopted to determine the difference or similarity across groups. For example, Han et al.
(2021) divided airline travelers into a high-perceived-risk
group and a low-perceived-risk group and conducted a metric
invariance test in order to examine the moderating effect of
perceived risks on eco-friendly technology product acceptance behaviors. Hwang, Kim, Kim, et al. (2021) used a metric invariance test to assess the different degrees of effect of
attitude on behavioral intentions across low versus high levels

of product involvement in the robotic restaurant context.
Therefore, a metric invariance test, along with a chi-squared
test, was used to identify the moderating effect of personal
characteristics (i.e., consumer innovativeness and previous
experience) and product characteristics (i.e., structural assurance and media encouragement) in the relationship between
perceived risk and attitude toward CBDC payment. The analyses were conducted using SPSS 25.0 and AMOS 23.0.

Results
Profiles of Survey Respondents
First, this study performed frequency analysis to understand
respondents’ profiles. The respondents’ demographic characteristics are as follows. The total sample of 795 comprised
414 Koreans and 381 Chinese. These respondents were
divided almost equally between males and females: 49.9%
(N = 397) males and 50.1% (N = 398) females. Their average
age was 37.3 years. With regard to their educational background, 51.1% had graduated from a 4-year university, and
21.3% had finished graduate school. In total, 21.0% reported
that their income was between 55,000 and 69,999 U.S. dollars per year, 18.4% indicated between 25,000 and 39,999
U.S. dollars, and 17.9% indicated between 70,000 and
84,999 U.S. dollars. With regard to the frequency of purchasing tourism products, 35.1% indicated that they usually
bought products two to three times a year, and 23.5% reported
four to five purchases a year.

Measurement Model
The validity of the measurement model was determined using
CFA. The results showed an appropriate fit to the current

study data: χ2 = 447.983, df = 186, p < 0.001; χ2/df = 2.409;
incremental fit index (IFI) = 0.986; comparative fit index
(CFI) = 0.986; Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.982; root-meansquare (RMSEA) = 0.042 (Byrne, 2001). All measurement
items for constructs were signiﬁcantly loaded except one of
the measurements for time risk, and we removed this specific
item from the measurement model. As Table 1 shows, the
standardized factor loadings for all items ranged from 0.848
to 0.912, which were greater than the commonly suggested
level of 0.6. The skewness and kurtosis of each measurement
were between −0.932 and 0.294, with a standard error of
0.087, and between −1.030 and 0.747, with a standard error of
0.173, respectively, which lay within the acceptable ranges
following Kline’s (2005) recommendation. Hence, the normality assumption was supported.
According to Hair et al. (2006), convergent validity can
be established based on each construct’s average variance

extracted (AVE). AVE values were calculated, and all values
were greater than the recommended value of 0.5. Also, we
computed composite reliability (CR) values for each variable
in order to assess internal consistency. The CR values range
was between 0.733 and 0.909, which exceeded the minimum
level of 0.70 (Hair et al., 2006), and therefore, internal reliability was established. Discriminant validity was estimated
following Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) criterion. As Table 2
displays, the results showed that the AVE value for each construct was greater than the square of the correlation between
each pair of variables, except for the link between financial
risk and performance risk. According to Bagozzi and Yi’s
(1988) guideline, a χ2 difference test between a constrained
model and an unconstrained model was performed for this
exception, and the difference of χ2(1) was 76.488, which is
far greater than 3.941 (df = 1), established discriminant
validity.

SEM
This study used SEM to test the two proposed hypotheses
(see Table 3). The goodness-of-fit statistics, χ2 = 546.859,
df = 200, p < 0.001; χ2/df = 2.734; IFI = 0.981; CFI = 0.981;
TLI = 0.978; RMSEA = 0.047, confirmed an acceptable level.
The analysis results showed that perceived risk signiﬁcantly
and negatively influenced attitude toward CBDC payment
(β = −0.126, t = −3.346, p < 0.001). Attitude toward CBDC
payment had a signiﬁcant and positive effect on the intention
to adopt CBDC payment (β = 0.754, t = 23.772, p < 0.001).
Therefore, both Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 were supported. In addition, we computed the weights of ﬁrst-order
constructs on designated second-order constructs, and the
results were as follows for financial risk (β = 0.891), performance risk (β = 0.984), privacy risk (β = 0.916), psychological risk (β = 0.898), and time risk (β = 0.901).

Metric Invariance Test
The moderating effect of personal characteristics, including
consumer innovativeness and previous experience, was estimated using a metric invariance test (see Table 4). First, we
divided the group depending on the degree of consumer
innovativeness, using its mean value. As a result, we classified the respondents into a low level of consumer innovativeness (N = 380) and a high level of consumer
innovativeness (N = 412). We then compared the structural
invariance between the freely estimated model and the
equally constrained model. The goodness-of-fit statistics of
the baseline model were χ2 = 1202.694, df = 404, p < .001;
χ2/df = 2.977; IFI = 0.952; CFI = 0.952; TLI = 0.945;
RMSEA = 0.050, while the goodness-of-fit statistics of the
nested model were χ2 = 1211.987, df = 405, p < .001;
χ2/df = 2.993; IFI = 0.952; CFI = 0.952; TLI = 0.945;
RMSEA = 0.050. Thus, the result showed a significantly different chi-squared value of 9.293 (Δdf = 1), p < .05, confirming Hypothesis 3. The distinct difference between the two
groups was that perceived risk was a significant antecedent
of attitude toward CBDC payment for the low consumer
innovativeness group (β = −0.237, t = −4.107, p < .001),

whereas it was insignificant for the high consumer innovativeness group (β = −0.078, t = −1.486, p > .05).
With regard to the moderating role of previous experience, we divided the respondents into those who had ever
held and used cryptocurrency or virtual currency for buying
products/services (N = 287) and those who had never held
them (N = 508). The goodness-of-fit statistics of the baseline
model were χ2 = 1173.032, df = 404, p < .001; χ2/df = 2.904;
IFI = 0.958; CFI = 0.958; TLI = 0.952; RMSEA = 0.049, confirming an acceptable level. Structural invariance comparison showed a significant difference in the chi-squared values
at 7.450 (Δdf = 1) and p < .05. The adverse effect of perceived
risk on attitude toward CBDC payment became severe for
individuals without experience of holding cryptocurrency or
virtual currency. Hence, Hypothesis 4 was supported.
In order to determine the moderating effect of product
characteristics, we conducted the same procedure that was
used to identify the moderating effect of personal characteristics. We divided the group depending on how respondents
perceived the level of structural assurance related to CBDC.
Using the mean value, we grouped 375 responses showing a
low level of structural assurance and 420 responses with a
high level of structural assurance. Then, the structural invariance of the baseline model was compared with a nested
model. The goodness-of-fit statistics of the freely estimated
model were χ2 = 1107.780, df = 404, p < .001; χ2/df = 2.742;
IFI = 0.960; CFI = 0.960; TLI = 0.954; RMSEA = 0.047,
which indicated an acceptable fit to the data. The results also
showed a significant difference in the chi-squared value
(Δχ2(1) = 13.899, p < .001) from the equally constrained
model. The distinct difference between the two groups was
that perceived risk was a significant predictor of attitude
toward CBDC payment for the low structural assurance
group (β = −0.234, t = −4.259, p < .001), whereas it was
insignificant for the high structural assurance group
(β = −0.015, t = −0.293, p > .05).
Similarly, we divided the group depending on how
respondents perceived the level of media encouragement
related to CBDC. We classified the respondents into a low
level of media encouragement (N = 387) and a high level of

difference (Δχ2(1) = 7.755, p < .05) between the chi-squared
values of these two models. The negative effect of perceived
risk on attitude was prominent for the group who perceived a
low degree of media encouragement. Both Hypothesis 5 and
Hypothesis 6 were accordingly supported (see Table 5).

Discussion and Implications
Discussion
CBDC has been introduced as a likely innovation in the foreseeable future, and it is highly likely to promote diversity in
payment options and increase financial inclusion (Auer &
Böhme, 2020). Moreover, as economies go digital, its

practical role of making cross-border and online payments
faster and cheaper will be invaluable, and CBDC is therefore
perhaps greatly to be welcomed. However, novel offerings
are generally associated with various risks, which may have
an adverse effect on adoption behavior (Chauhan et al., 2019;
Han et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2022). To date, there have been
few efforts to estimate consumers’ risk perceptions of CBDC
payments from the point of view of travelers. The current
study set out to bridge this research gap by exploring the
effect of a multidimensional risk factor in the formation of
consumer acceptance of CBDC payments. In addition, this
study paid particular attention to personal characteristics and
product characteristics linked to CBDC, which can potentially influence the relationship between perceived risk and
attitude toward CBDC payment.
Based on a multidimensional approach to perceived risk
associated with CBDC payment, our study revealed that the
most significant first-order dimension was the performance
risk in the international tourism sector. Also, this study found
that perceived risk greatly influenced attitudes toward CBDC
payment. The results indicated that lower perceived risk

would result in more favorable attitudes toward CBDC payment. This outcome can be explained on the basis of risk
perception theory. It is also in accordance with earlier studies
(e.g., Choe et al., 2021; Hwang, Kim, Kim, et al., 2021),
which observed that individuals with a high-risk perception
toward innovations tended to exhibit avoidance behavior.
The CBDC payment system is the most recent payment system to have been developed and many people see it as a
novel alternative to existing payment methods (Radic et al.,
2022). There are multiple unsolved issues associated with
CBDC, which has yet to roll out in many places (Okuwoga,
2021). The current status of CBDC may make people feel
unclear or uncertain about several aspects that entail risk,
including financial, performance, privacy, psychological,
and time aspects. A close attitude-to-behavior relationship
was evident. That is, attitude toward CBDC payment influences the intention to adopt this specific payment innovation.
This result resonates with extant studies that have documented the need for building a positive attitude in order to
increase intention and engage in a specific behavior (Kaur &
Arora, 2020; Martins et al., 2014).
This study found a significant role the for moderating
variables that reflect personal characteristics, namely, consumer innovativeness and previous experience. The findings
indicated that the negative effect of perceived risk on attitude
is strong for individuals with low innovativeness. Existing
studies have underlined the positive role of consumer innovativeness in adoption behavior across different sectors
(Hwang, Kim, & Lee, 2021; Jeong et al., 2017; F. Zhang
et al., 2020). Our finding specifically echoes the prior finding that determined its role in mitigating perceived risks of
novel payment systems (Aldás-Manzano et al., 2009).

Another factor this study addressed, which could strengthen
or weaken the link between perceived risk and attitude
toward CBDC payment, was previous experience. The analysis showed that the negative effect of perceived risk on attitude was significant for people without previous experience.
One possible reason for this outcome is that people who have
ever held cryptocurrency or virtual currency may be more
familiar with the use of digital currencies to complete transactions. This is in line with Kaur and Arora’s (2020) study
that confirmed the moderating role of prior experience in
building consumers’ intention to adopt internet banking.
In addition, this study identified the positive role of
product characteristics, in terms of structural assurance and
media encouragement, in minimizing the negative effect of
perceived risk on attitude. This result supports the existing
studies (e.g., Filotto et al., 2021; Zhou, 2011) that have
noted the positive influence of structural assurance in
inducing consumer adoption behavior with regard to payment innovations. This implies that governance and
accountability are important in the context of payment
innovation. Also, it was found that the negative effect of
perceived risk on attitude was greater for those with a low
degree of media encouragement. Digital forms of money,
specifically CBDC, are supposed to improve various
aspects of current financial transactions. Despite that, customers may feel a lack of confidence in using CBDC as it
has not yet been commercialized, and our results indicated
that media messages related to CBDC play an essential
role. This finding aligns with the extant literature, which
supports the crucial role of media encouragement in forming acceptance behavior toward innovations (Radic et al.,
2022; Zolait & Sulaiman, 2009).

12

Theoretical Implications
Four major research objectives framed this study. They were
all based on quantitative procedures and yielded the following theoretical implications. First, J. J. Kim et al. (2022),
who used the five-stage consumer adoption model, showed
that the proposed model predicted consumer acceptance of
CBDC for buying products/services and revealed that consumer innovativeness moderated the relationship between
interest and evaluation and evaluation and trial intention.
Radic et al. (2022) also explored the effects of attitude toward
CBDC payment, relative advantage, perceived risk, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on tourists’
behavioral intention to adopt CBDC payment. Prior studies
also did not address the multidimensionality of perceived
risk in using CBDC. For example, while Radic et al. (2022)
used perceived risk as one of the antecedents to the adoption
of the CBDC payment system, they did not consider the multidimensional structure of the perceived risk. However, the
current study conceptualized perceived risk as five components, adopting the findings of Littler and Melanthiou (2006),
and futher tested whether perceived risk has a significant
impact on tourists’ attitudes toward CBDC.
Second, in line with the first implication, this study conceptualized a facet-based perceived risk, which supports the
parsimonious second-order typology of risk perception (e.g.,
Kaur & Arora, 2020; Martins et al., 2014; S. Park &
Tussyadiah, 2017). Our results validated a second-order composite of perceived risk and helped to establish a better understanding of risks associated with CBDC in a readily
comprehensible manner. In addition, it was evident that the
significance of risk perceptions may not necessarily be the
same for every innovation. For example, Yadav et al. (2015)
found that perceived risks toward internet banking did not
influence consumer behavior. The relationship between perceived risk and online purchase intention was not statistically
supported in Ventre and Kolbe’s (2020) study. Yi et al. (2020)
determined that risk perception related to the performance of
the sharing economy in the tourism industry did not adversely
affect the adoption intention. In this regard, our findings provided evidence that the perceived risk of CBDC payment
plays a critical role in influencing consumer behavior.
Second, there are only a few research studies that describe
the influence of perceived risk on travelers’ attitudes toward
CBDC payment. Therefore, it was worth investigating
whether there is a relationship between travelers’ perceived
risk and their attitudes toward CBDC, one of the latest digital
payment systems. CBDC can contribute to modernizing the
current monetary system; however, this study observed that
people perceive risks, specifically financial, performance,
privacy, psychological, and time risks, which in turn affect
attitude. The role of each facet of perceived risk differs considerably between novel products/services. For example,
physical risk is a large component of the perceived risk of
electric airplanes (Han et al., 2019), whereas privacy and

Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research 00(0)
security risks are more relevant in the field of mobile travel
booking platforms (S. Park & Tussyadiah, 2017).
Nonetheless, prior studies (e.g., Radic et al, 2022) that
regarded perceived risk as a unidimensional construct in the
tourism sector do not provide evidence that a specific facet
largely accounts for a perceived risk toward CBDC. The current study fills voids left by previous research as it found that
performance risk played a salient role in shaping the perceived risk relating to CBDC. However, financial risk had a
minimal impact. Accordingly, it suggests the primary focus
is performance risk, in order to reduce risk perceptions relating to CBDC payment. Furthermore, the finding of a significant association between attitude and intention supports the
related theory proposed by Ajzen and Fishbein (1977).
Third, this study underlines the influencing role of consumer innovativeness and previous experience in the context
of payment innovation. Numerous studies have indicated the
critical role of personal characteristics in consumer adoption
behavior toward innovation. A unique contribution made by
the present research is the finding that consumer innovativeness and previous experience moderated the relationship
between perceived risk and attitude in the area of CBDC
payment innovation. This study also makes a contribution to
the current literature regarding the impact of individual characteristics on customer responses to payment innovations.
Fourth, this study improved our understanding of the
moderating impact of product characteristics. The importance of structural assurance cannot be overstated, and it is
an important step toward developing more positive attitudes
toward CBDC payment. As stated earlier, this study provided
evidence of the negative effect of perceived risk associated
with CBDC on attitude to the use of CBDC payment systems. This result is similar to previous payment innovations,
such as cryptocurrency (M. Kim, 2021). However, this study
paid extra attention to the particular difference between
CBDC and the current cryptocurrencies available in the market. CBDC is centralized and regulated by national financial
institutions (Bindseil, 2019; Shkliar, 2020), which should
increase individuals’ beliefs and trust. This research was one
of the first attempts to examine structural assurance related
to CBDC in forming consumer behavior and showed that
personal and product characteristics have a decisive effect on
the link between perceived risk and attitude. Furthermore,
this study identified the prime role of media encouragement,
which diminishes the negative effect of perceived risk on
attitude. This study produced empirical evidence on how
media can contribute to the successful implementation of
CBDC payment innovation.

Practical implications
The CBDC payment system is expected to lead to a paradigm
shift for international financial transaction systems and it will
improve the current GFN and facilitate the creation of a cashless society (Wang & Gao, 2021). Many parts of the world are

Kim et al.
experiencing a revival in international tourism. The growth in
international tourism demands easy, inexpensive, and seamless cross-border payments, and the CBDC system could play
an important role in revitalizing the tourism industry (J. J.
Kim et al., 2022; World Bank, 2021). Therefore, this research
tried to address issues specifically related to tourists’ adoption
behavior toward CBDC payment.
This study also provides important managerial suggestions for stakeholders involved in this modern payment system. First, this study has demonstrated that the CBDC
payment system is affected by perceived risks, and the risk
dimensions have been clearly identified. Therefore, financial
institutions can take this into consideration, and make
improvements in collaboration with developers of the system
to downsize the perceived risks of transactions and build the
confidence of customers to rely on CBDC payment systems.
Efforts should be made to lower the performance risk related
to CBDC payment. In order to establish that technologies
around CBDC payment are reliable, online booking platforms in the tourism industry could, for example, introduce a
video clip that demonstrates how travelers can use CBDC
payment without problems.
Second, this study showed that low consumer innovativeness (Aldás-Manzano et al., 2009) and a lack of past experience (Kaur and Arora, 2020) negatively affect customers’
attitudes and their intention to adopt the CBDC payment system. This implies that there is a need to promote the payment
system and increase customers’ technical skills. This can be
done by financial institutions, and other end users such as
tourism organizations, by producing short, free podcasts that
create awareness and improve the technical skills of users
such as tourists. Therefore, CBDC institutions need to provide customers with more and correct information on CBDC
so that customers are more exposed to the payment system
and can perceive reduced risk.
Third, the results of this study can contribute to the
enhanced use of CBDC payments in the travel and tourism
industry, which is currently under high pressure as a result of
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study
identified some determining factors of this contactless system, which can enhance international or border-cross travel
(Gross et al., 2021) and reduce the risk of the pandemic
(Rennie & Steele, 2021) through the provision of contactless
services (Seth, 2022). The existing literature has also shown
that CBDC is advantageous for ease of use, safety, speed,
stability, and reliability (Bindseil, 2019; Radic et al., 2022) in
financial transaction processes. The findings of this study
also provide information for central banks worldwide to help
with the issue of CBDC by integrating it with their own monetary policies and transaction systems. Furthermore, this
study provides evidence of how structural assurance, or regulations, promises, guarantees, and contracts (Shapiro,
1987a; Zucker, 1986) affect attitudes toward adopting the
CBDC payment system. To effectively implement this payment system, financial institutions need to build systems
their customers can trust and use payment methods that

13
support perceptions of low risk. The adoption of the system
will depend on diverse factors, including the transparency of
transaction, the protection of privacy, the domestic political
situation, legal and regulatory support, and customers’ trust
in the economic system (Wang, 2022).

Limitations and Future Studies
The findings of this study should be understood in light of
several limitations. Although the correlations did not reach a
problematic level, several constructs had relatively high correlations. Future studies should carefully design the measurement structure to minimize correlation issues. In
addition, not every country is adequately prepared for the
adoption of CBDC. Since this study collected data from the
most mature countries with regard to CBDC, caution should
be exercised in applying the findings to other countries.
Therefore, more studies are needed to assess whether the distinctiveness persists across countries. Last, this study specifically focused on the tourism sector in estimating risk
perceptions associated with CBDC payment and the consequences, and similar studies in the other contexts may generate different findings.
