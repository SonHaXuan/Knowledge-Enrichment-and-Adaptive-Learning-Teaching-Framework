Performance risk
   The performance of the CBDC payment might create problems with my credit.                                                       0.860
   CBDC payments do not seem to perform well.                                                                                      0.884
   Considering the expected level of performance of CBDC payment, it would be risky to use it.                                     0.872
Privacy risk

   Others may steal personal information when using CBDC payment.                                                                  0.931
