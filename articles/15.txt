Abstract: We develop a medium size dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to assess
the macroeconomic consequences of introducing an interest-bearing central bank digital currency
(CBDC), an electronic alternative of payment with public use properties of cash and that can furnish
as bank settlement balances. The model consists of seven sectors, namely households, retail firms,
wholesale firms, capital producing firms, commercial banks, central bank, and government, and
offers rich features. The use of cash and CBDC is differentiated with respect to their prices and
transaction costs. In particular, we quantify the effects of negative shock on CBDC transaction cost to
evaluate the potential of CBDC as an alternate instrument in liquidity holding in addition to cash
and bank deposits. We also examine the effects of productivity shock and monetary policy shock on
CBDC interest rate and CBDC demand, and their interaction with other main variables of the model.

1. Introduction
The rise of privately issued digital currencies supported by the advancement of
transaction validation technology has raised concerns among central banks and other
monetary authorities. The rapid innovation of the payment infrastructure offers new
alternate payment platforms to compete with central bank paper money, i.e., cash as the
only form of central bank money available for customers. Digital or virtual currencies,
popularly known as crypto-currencies, have broadened the option of payment settlement
and have automated contracts. Additionally, due to the invention of blockchain, which
uses distributed ledger technology (DLT), crypto-currencies can function in an open and
decentralized fashion independent of any controlling entity, while ensuring safety and
anonymity [1].
The advent of crypto-currencies as payment solutions has posed challenges to central
banks to consider upgrading the concept and provision of money. This payment diversity
is, however, coincidence with the decline of the use of cash as a means of payment due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The wish to avoid coronavirus transmission through banknotes
and coins has accelerated a shift from cash to digital transactions. As reported by Bank
for International Settlements (BIS) [2], there was a decline in the total number of cash
withdrawals by 23% and more than 10% in value. It is cited by Balz [3] that the worldwide
transactions using PayPal have increased from about USD 3.26 billion in the first quarter
of 2020 to around USD 3.74 billion in the second quarter. Additionally, the number of
transactions using girocard in Germany in the first semester of 2020 was 21 percent up
on the first two quarters of 2019, increasing the volume of transactions to USD 2.6 billion.

Cashless payments are expected to continue considering that consumers who had been
conducting such payments prior to the pandemic have been even more likely to do so [4].
Recently, according to what BIS reported in [5], no less than eighty percent of central
banks worldwide have begun studying the process and consequences of introducing their own
version of a digital currency, namely a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Almost 50 percent
of central banks have run CBDC-related experiments or released proofs-of-concept. Moreover,
about 10 percent of the surveyed central banks project to establish a generally available (retail)
CBDC in the short run (up to three years) and around 20 percent in the medium term (up to
six years). In 2014, China’s central bank (PBoC) starts focusing on the development of a CBDC
by forming a special task force. In 2015, the Bank of England was pioneering a series of studies
to assess the potential of CBDCs. In 2017, e-krona was proposed to study by Riksbank, the
central bank of Sweden, in response to the weakening of the use of cash to the lowest level
in the world. This initiative is then followed by Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean Currency
Union, and the Marshall Islands [6]. Some emerging economies including Tunisia, Lithuania,
Venezuela, and Uruguay also implemented pilot programs to test CBDCs.
A CBDC can loosely be described as an electronic alternative of cash issued by a
central bank. From the household’s perspective, CBDCs can thus mimic the public use
characteristics of cash and from commercial banks and other financial institutions with the
payment system point of views, CBDCs can furnish as electronic central bank deposits,
also known as reserves or settlement balances [7]. From a theoretical viewpoint, there are
two important and long-standing questions regarding the issuance of a CBDC, namely the
provision of public and private money, and the ability of the central bank to harness CBDC
as a direct monetary policy tool to households. A central bank may consider introducing
a CBDC with the following reasons: to ensure payment resilience, prevent private sector
monopolies in the payment market, and strengthen monetary sovereignty [8].
Despite the luminous potential of CBDC, academicians and central banks have been
in the combination of cautious and curious. They have recently started to examine merits
and dangers of introducing CBDC. A series of CBDC-related studies and discussions were
carried-out to address the aforementioned questions by focusing on the consequences of
introducing a CBDC on commercial banks and monetary policy as well as financial stability
and welfare implications [9]. To our knowledge, no study tries to examine the multiple
roles of CBDC in their models. Particularly, there is no existing study that unifies the roles
of CBDC in macroeconomics and monetary policy. Given the existing gaps, the objectives
of this paper are to develop a medium size dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
model in a closed economy, where a CBDC is introduced as an alternative liquidity asset as
well as a monetary policy instrument, and to quantify the macroeconomic consequences
in the presence of interest-bearing CBDCs in competing with cash and bank deposits as
well as the implication for optimal monetary policy. In order to differentiate with other
studies, we extent some models of money-in-utility function [10,11], cash presence [8], price
setting [12], and interest rate [13]. DSGE model is a prominent tool for policy analysis
of central banking and contributes a major strand of the modern macroeconomics literature. The ability of DSGE models to quantitatively reveal macroeconomic fluctuations
are then strengthened after seminal works of Christiano et al. [14] on the inertia and
persistence of inflation in aggregate quantities subject to a monetary policy shock and
Smets & Wouters [15] on Bayesian estimation of monetary business cycle model with sticky
wages and prices. Since then, DSGE models have extensively been adopted for various
purposes in macroeconomics forecasting.
2. Related Works: Modeling CBDC
From a theoretical point of view, the introduction of central bank digital currency
poses some challenging questions relating to the supply of public and private money
and the ability of the central bank to utilize CBDC as a tool to increase the efficiency of
monetary policy. Despite its potential, CBDCs could threaten the stability of banking and
financial systems. Bank runs and disintermediation may occur when a substantial amount

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

3 of 33

of bank deposits is converted into CBDCs. Deposit outflows decrease banks’ funding
ability and therefore, decline the volume of loan, investment, and economic activities in
general [8]. Thus, the focus of theoretical literature in CBDC modeling lays in the effect of
CBDC on commercial banks, monetary policy, financial stability, and welfare implications.
Literature in this topic of research can be divided into three strands [16]: papers introducing
a CBDC in general, papers presenting a CBDC in DSGE model, and those analyzing a
CBDC in an open economy setting.
2.1. Non-DSGE Models
In the first strand, i.e., non-DSGE modeling of CBDC, many researchers utilize a stylized and often two-period model to assess the implication of CBDC in domestic economy.
Agur et al. [17] discuss the optimal design of interest and non-interest bearing CBDCs. In
this network effect induced environment, economic agents may choose cash, CBDC, and
bank deposits based on their preferences over anonymity and security. Two-period model
economy which consists of households, banks, firms, and a central bank is considered to
maximize welfare. In the first period, the central bank decides whether and in what form to
introduce a CBDC. Then, in the second period, households decide to use either cash, bank
deposits, or CBDC (if introduced by central bank) in their transactions. Commercial banks
extend loan to firms by using deposits from households. It is found that, when network
effect matter, the interest bearing CBDC can be introduced by central bank to alleviate the
trade-off between maintaining intermediation versus the diverse instruments of payment.
Andolfatto [18] develops an overlapping generation model as a combination of the
Diamond government debt model and Klein-Monti monopoly bank model to study the
impact of interest bearing CBDC on monopolistic banking sector. It is shown that CBDC has
no damaging effect toward lending activity of banks. More precisely, if the CBDC interest
rate is independently set of the interest of reserve, then the establishment of CBDC will
not discourage the lending activities. Accordingly, if CBDC interest rate is fixed below the
interest of reserve, then there is an incentive for the monopoly banks to match the CBDC
rate for the purpose of retaining deposits. Thus, it is shown by the model that introduction
of an interest-bearing CBDC does reduce bank monopoly profit, but does not necessarily
lead to bank disintermediation.
The optimal monetary in an environment where cash and CBDC co-exist is studied by
Davoodalhosseini [19]. By adapting Lagos–Wright model into two-period setting, i.e., a
model with decentralized and centralized markets, an economy with only cash, only CBDC,
or both of cash and CBDC can be analyzed. It is found that, under small carrying cost, the
introduction of CBDC enables the central bank to acquire better allocations than with cash.
By calibrating the model to the Canadian and US data, it is revealed that introducing CBDC
can lead to an increase of up to 0.64 percent and 1.6 percent in consumption for Canada and
for the US, respectively. The Lagos–Wright model with decentralized–centralized markets
is also considered by [20]. Chiu et al. [21,22] develop a model of a banking system with
imperfect competition to investigate the effect of general equilibrium of establishing CBDC.
It is discovered that the introduction of CBDC as an outside option for households can still
improve the efficiency of bank intermediation and increase lending and aggregate output,
even if its usage is low. Furthermore, when the model is calibrated to the US economy, it is
shown that CBDC can increase the volume of bank lending and investment by 6 percent
under the proper interest rate. The output can also be increased by a maximum of 1 percent.
Keister & Monnet [23] study the effect of CBDC establishment on the financial stability
under the condition of private information about the quality of assets held by the bank.
In this work, the seminal model of Diamond–Dybvig on bank runs is modified in such
a way that patient and impatient agents face two types of liquidity shocks. It is shown
that, by observing the funds inflow into CBDC, the central bank can deduce the financial
condition of bank more quickly and monitoring the flow of funds into this new asset.
Diamond–Dybvig model on bank runs is also adapted by Fernandez-Villaverde et al. [24]

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

to study the impact of CBDC on financial stability and bank runs in which banks can offer
nominal contracts. Other papers thematically most similar with this are [25–27].
2.2. DSGE Models
Studies in the second strand employ DSGE framework to model the consequences of CBDC
on economy. It is well known that the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models
are widely used to explain and predict co-movements of aggregate time series over the business
cycle. DSGE models can be viewed as an objectively good representation of a market economy
mechanism. DSGE models can also be considered as the leading tool to evaluate the relative
strength of interaction among agents [28]. However, the DSGE approach has also received
criticism by economists. Among others, it is raised by [29] that DSGE failed to incorporate key
aspects of economic behavior, especially in predicting or responding to a financial crisis (see
for instance, [30]). Blanchard [31] lists many reasons to dislike current DSGE models: from its
unappealing assumptions and unconvincing estimation method to its inability to communicate
with other types of general equilibrium models and, of course, Lucas’ critique on parameter
instability due to changes in economic policy [32]. Criticism on DSGE is also boosted by the
Austrian school of economic thought. The core of the school lies in the inability of DSGE models
to adapt to economic changes, particularly in dealing with the diversity of agents, preferences,
and information sets. Other concerns relate to the heterogeneity and multi-specification of
capital stock and production function, which can lead to malinvestment and sensitive to policy
shocks [33–35]. Regardless the flaws, DSGE still serves to guide debates about the direction
of the economy [31], provides policy evaluation exercises [36], and offers simplification and
flexibility to be used for many purposes [37]. Rebuilding Macroeconomic Theory, set up by
the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, is a project to rebuild the benchmark New Keynesian
model [30].
Compared to the use of the non-DSGE models, research on the effects of CBDC using
the DSGE models is still rare. Gross & Schiller [8] build a DSGE model to evaluate the
effects of interest and non-interest bearing CBDC, especially in the period of financial crises.
A Gertler–Karadi model is adopted by focusing the household utility maximization, bank
intermediation in lending, and the central bank role. In particular, households have three
instruments of saving with remuneration, liquidity, and risk exposures, i.e., bank deposits,
CBDC, and government bonds. It is found that the effect of bank deposits crowd out can
be mitigated by assigning additional central bank funds or setting a low CBDC interest
rates to disincentivize large-scale CBDC accumulation. Barrdear & Kumhof [38] propose a
monetary-financial DSGE model and assess the steady state effects of an interest-bearing
CBDC. Calibration of the model to pre-2008 US data shows that even if CBDC introduction
of 30 percent of GDP would cause a bank deposits outflow, the output could still increase
by three percent in the long run.
A New Keynesian DSGE model consisting of three economic sectors, namely households, commercial bank, and central bank, is examined by Luo et al. [39] to analyze the
impact of electronic money (including CBDC) on monetary policy and, specifically, the
impact of behavior changes on savings, loans, output, and interest rate. The simulation
results suggest that electronic money exhibits asymmetric effects on savings and loans,
but an irrational distortion on households, electronic money influences the interest rate
in reverse manner leading to the management difficulties of the micro subjects and affecting the monetary policy effectiveness, and electronic money has the effect of restraining
risk. Lim et al. [40] develop a DSGE model equipped with cash and digital currency to
quantify the effect of loan prime rate (LPR) setting and CBDC introduction in China. Using
Bayesian estimation, the optimal LPR can be designed to improve the stability property of
post-CBDC economy.
2.3. Open Economy Models
Open economy means an economy open to trade and capital flows. The third strand
of research topic extend the DSGE models into open economy context. This direction is

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

5 of 33

more challenging compared to a standard closed economy as we now allow, for instance,
the world demand and transmission channel through exchange rate. The results regarding
CBDC effect through DSGE modeling in open economy are thin. George et al. [41] extend
the Barrdear–Kumhof model to a small open economy by introducing foreign sector,
where export–import activities and capital flows are possible. It is discovered that the
introduction of CBDC with an adjustable interest rate may improve the welfare and increase
the monetary policy effectiveness. Moreover, exchange rate and inflation exhibit more
stable movements. Ferrari et al. [16] build a two-country open economy DSGE model to
assess the international transmission of standard monetary policy and technology shocks in
light of two scenarios, namely with and without CBDC, and to explore the monetary policy
optimality and households’ welfare in the economies. It is shown that the introduction of
CBDC strengthen the international spillovers of shocks to a significant extent, thus reinforce
international connections. A DSGE model proposed by Benigno et al. [42] discusses the
two-country open economy nature of more globally issued crypto-currencies, which are
different in safety and reputation with CBDC. The presence of a crypto-currency in a home
and a foreign environment with two national currencies is analyzed in the framework of
monetary policy autonomy.
3. The Model Economy
We follow the standard framework of DSGE modeling to assess the macroeconomic
consequences of introducing an interest-bearing CBDC, especially we want to know how
the cash will compete with CBDC with respect to their prices and transaction costs. In
this section, we outline the economy of our model and expose the optimization problems
solved by households and firms. We also describe the behavior of financial intermediaries
by commercial bank and the monetary and fiscal authorities by the central bank and
the government.
3.1. Assumptions
Our model economy is populated by seven classes of agents: a continuum of identical
households of measure unity indexed by h ∈ [0, 1], a retail firm or final-good producing firm,
a continuum of wholesale firms or intermediate-good producing firms indexed by j ∈ [0, 1], a
capital-producing firm, commercial banks, the central bank as a monetary authority and the
government as a fiscal authority. In a representative agent model, identical agents in household
and firm sectors mean that all agents differ, but they act in such a way that the sum of their
preferences is mathematically equivalent to the decision of one representative agent.
The basic structure of our DSGE model is depicted in Figure 1. The model is built
according to the closed economy New Keynesian framework by [8,43,44]. Households
consume and supply labor to wholesale firms, receive wages, choose the real levels of cash,
deposits, and CBDC to hold at the beginning of the period, and pay lump-sum tax to the
government. As the owners, households also receive dividends from firms and commercial
banks. Retail firm aggregates imperfectly substitutable intermediate goods into a single
final good, which is used for consumption, investment, or government spending. The
final good is sold at a perfectly competitive price. Wholesale firms use the labor provided
by households and capital to produce a unique good that is sold on the monopolistically
competitive market. Wages are fully flexible and adjust to clear the market. Capitalproducing firm purchases the final good for investment and combines it with existing
capital stock to produce new capital goods. Commercial bank is owned by households. The
bank supplies credit to wholesale firms to finance their short-term working capital needs,
supplies credit to the capital-producing firm for investment financing, pays interest on
household deposits and central bank loans, and holds minimum reserves against deposits
at the central bank without remuneration. The central bank regulates the commercial
bank and sets its policy interest rate using a Taylor-type rule and supplies all the credit
demanded by the bank at the prevailing refinance rate. The government issues bonds,
receives tax payments, and makes spending.

In some respects, we follow approaches developed in previous studies by others and
in different standpoints we make few extensions. Our model has the following features:

We consider a money-in-utility (MIU) intertemporal welfare function to be maximized
by households [10,11]. The presence of cash in addition to bank deposits and CBDC
is slightly extend the one by Gross & Schiller [8]. The cash also appears in the
budget constraint.
In the profit maximization of wholesale firms, we adopt the so-called Calvo price
setting mechanism, where firms have a certain probability of either keeping the price
fixed in the next period or optimally determining the price [12].
Similar to [8,13], the nominal interest rate on CBDC follows the interest rate of central
bank funding considering the financial stress expressed as the percentage deviation
of banks’ equity from steady state. This rule is intended to disincentivize CBDC
accumulation in a crisis.
Government bonds are held by banks and the central bank.
To quantify the effect of disruptions by economic shocks, our model is equipped with
three shock generators, namely productivity shock, liquidity demand shock, and the
monetary policy shock.

3.2. Households
In this model, the economy is populated by a continuum of households indexed by
h ∈ [0, 1] whose problem is to maximize a particular intertemporal welfare function. To this
end, a money-in-utility function proposed by Sidrauski [10] and in the form of the constant
relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function is adopted. The lifetime utility function U H
is additively separable into consumption of goods Ch,t , supply of working hours Lh,t , and
saving in the form of bank deposits Dh,t , money holding in cash (real money balance)
Mh,t , and digital money holding in CBDC Eh,t . Each household h wants to maximize the
following expected utility:

where E0 stands for the rational expectation operator conditional on the information set

weighted by the price level Pi , β ∈ (0, 1) is the intertemporal discount factor, σ ∈ (0, 1) is
the relative risk aversion coefficient, αe , αm , αd > 0 are relative utility weights or preference

parameters of CBDC, cash, and bank deposits, respectively, ϕ is coefficient relates to
Frisch elasticity of labor supply, and ηe , ηm , ηd > 0 are coefficients relate to elasticity of
bank deposits, cash, and CBDC. Note that we may extend the form of household’s utility
H as discussed by, for
function by introducing wealth in the form of government bonds Bh,i
instance, Michaillat & Saez [45]. However, this extension modifies the properties of the
New Keynesian IS curve, where the interest rate is now negatively related to output instead
of being constant, equal to the time discount rate.
Households are assumed to consume goods, invest money, pay taxes, and receive
wages for their labor supplied. Households also own the firms and the banks, and therefore
receive dividends and profits sharing. Decisions made by households in maximizing (1)
must satisfy the following budget constraint:
Pt (Ch,t + I NVh,t ) + Eh,t + Mh,t + Dh,t + TAXh,t = Wt Lh,t + RtK Kh,t
FB
+ (1 + ItE−1 ) Eh,t−1 + Mh,t−1 + (1 + ItD−1 ) Dh,t−1 + Πh,t
. (2)

The terms on the left-hand side of (2) summarize the use of economic resources by
households, and those on the right-hand side indicate the economic resources. I NVh,t is
level of investment, TAXh,t is the lump sum tax, Wt is the level of wages, Kh,t is the capital
stock, RtK is the return on capital, ItE is the nominal interest rate of CBDC, ItD is the nominal
FB is the profit (dividend) from firms and banks. An
interest rate of bank deposits, and Πh,t
additional equation represents the capital stock dynamics is:
Kh,t+1 = I NVh,t + (1 − δ)Kh,t ,

(3)

where δ is the depreciation rate of physical capital.
Lifetime utility (1) maximization, with respect to Ch,t , Lh,t , Kh,t , Eh,t , Mh,t , and Dh,t , subject to budget constraint (2) and capital stock (3) yields the following first order conditions:

Under transaction costs of using cash and CBDC, the total consumption can be decomposed as follows:
Ct = CtM (1 + S(vtM )) + CtE (1 + S(vtE )),

(9)

where S(vtM ) and S(vtE ) are the transaction costs of using cash and CBDC, respectively, as
functions of money velocities vtM and vtE , while CtM and CtE are the consumption levels using
cash and CBDC. The money velocities with respect to cash and CBDC are, respectively,
given by:

Uribe [46] as follows:
√

S(vt ) = avt +
− 2 ab,
(12)
vt
where a and b√are all positive cost parameters. Cost function S has a satiation level of
velocity v∗ = b/a. We can easily verify that S is decreasing when vt < v∗ and increasing
when vt > v∗ . The transaction cost functions for cash and CBDC are given by:

where we denote StM = S(vtM ) and StE = S(vtE ), while ZtM and ZtE are the shocks on the
demand for total liquidities in term of cash and CBDC, respectively, which follow first
order autoregressive processes:
M
ln ZtM = ρ M ln ZtM
−1 + ε t ,

(15)

ln ZtE = ρ E ln ZtE−1 − ε Et ,

(16)

where ρ M , ρ E ∈ (0, 1) are the degree of persistence in the cash and CBDC demands, and
E

t ∼ N (0, σM ) and ε t ∼ N (0, σE ) are the errors. As pointed out by [38], an increase in St
E
or St can be considered as a flight to safety, meaning a higher demand for liquid assets for
a given volume of real economic transactions. CBDC that has cheaper transaction cost than
cash will have smaller parameters values, i.e., a E ≤ a M and bE ≤ b M .

the general price:

Pt = (( PtM )1−ζ + ( PtE )1−ζ ) 1−ζ .

(19)

The proofs for (17)–(19) are provided in Appendix C.
3.3. Retail Firms
Suppose that at time t wholesale firm j produces Yj,t units of intermediate good
and there are a continuum of intermediate goods over the unit interval [0, 1]. These
intermediate goods are CES aggregated by a retail firm (final good producer) to produce Yt .
The production technology for assembling intermediate goods to produce the final good is
given by the standard Dixit-Stiglitz technology [47]:

where θ > 1 represents the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods. With the
nominal price of a final good being denoted by Pt and that of a intermediate good j denoted
by Pj,t , the price of each intermediate good is taken as a given by retail firms. Therefore, the
representative retail firm chooses the quantities of intermediate goods such that maximize
its profits:

where the first term in (21) is the total revenue from selling final goods and the second term

leads to the following first order condition of profit maximization:

Equation (22) accounts the demand level of intermediate good j, which is directly
proportional to aggregate demand Yt and inversely proportional to its relative price
level Pt .
3.4. Wholesale Firms
Each wholesale firm j produces a perishable intermediate good that is sold on a
monopolistically competitive market. To produce these goods, each firm rents capital at the
price Rt from the capital good producer and combines it with labor from households. To
produce the output Yt , each wholesale firm has a Cobb–Douglas production function:
Yj,t = At K αj,t L1j,t−α ,

(23)

where K j,t is the amount of capital rented by wholesale firm j from capital market, L j,t is
the number of working hours supplied by households to firm j, α ∈ (0, 1) is the elasticity
of output with respect to capital, and At is the productivity shock, a variable that can be
interpreted as the level of general knowledge about the arts of production available in an
economy. It is assumed that productivity shocks follow a first-order autoregressive process,
such that:
ln At = ρ A ln At−1 + ε A
t ,

(24)

where ρ A ∈ (−1, 1) is the degree of persistence of the shock and ε A
t ∼ N (0, σA ) is the error.
Total wages should be transferred by wholesale firm j to household is Wt L j,t . However,
we assume that there is a possibility wholesale firm j can take a loan from commercial bank
to pay some part of wages in advance. The amount of the loan for this purpose, denoted by
IF , is given by:
Q j,t
IF
Q j,t
= k Q Wt L j,t ,

(25)

where k Q ∈ (0, 1) is the portion of total wages borrowed from bank. In [44], k Q represents
IF + (1 − k )W L and
the strength of the cost channel. As we may write Wt L j,t = Q j,t
t j,t
Q
since it is assumed that short-term loans for working capital do not carry any risk and
are therefore contracted at a rate that reflects only the marginal cost of borrowing from
the central bank, ItCB , which is the refinance rate [44], then the wages claim faced by the
wholesale firm is given by:
IF
(1 + ItCB ) Q j,t
+ (1 − k Q )Wt L j,t = (1 + k Q ItCB )Wt L j,t .

(26)

3.4.1. The Cost Minimization Problem
The wholesale firm solves a two-stage optimization problem. First, the firm j takes
the prices of the factors of production (return on capital RtK and wages Wt ) as given and
determines the amount of capital and labor that it will use to minimize its total production
cost. The total cost TCj,t to be minimized by the firm consists of wages bill (26) and
capital rent:
TCj,t = (1 + k Q RtL )Wt L j,t + RtK K j,t ,

(27)

subject to production function (23). The corresponding Lagrange function for this problem is:

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

10 of 33

a 1− a
L IF = (1 + k Q ItCB )Wt L j,t + RtK K j,t + ΛtIF (Yj,t − At K j,t
L j,t ),

(28)

where ΛtIF is the Lagrange multiplier. The first order condition with respect to L j,t and K j,t
are, respectively, as follow:
α
(1 + k Q ItCB )Wt − (1 − α)ΛtIF At K αj,t L−
j,t = 0,

RtK − αΛtIF At K αj,t−1 L1j,t−α = 0.
From the second condition, we have:
RtK K j,t
α
= ΛtIF At K αj,t L−

αL j,t
and substitution to the first condition provides:
K j,t
α(1 + k Q ItCB ) Wt

L j,t

RtK

(29)

Since none of the terms on the right hand side of (29) depend on j, then the capital-labor
ratio will be the same across all firms.
From (29) we may express Kt as:
Kt =

α(1 + k Q ItCB ) Wt

(30)

By substituting (30) into total cost (27) we obtain:

and by substituting (30) into production function (23) we get:

or equivalently:

3.4.2. The Profit Maximization Problem
In the second stage, wholesale firm wants to maximize the real profits it gives back to
households. Since the real marginal cost is the optimal cost of producing one unit of goods,
the firm’s problem is to maximize:
IF
Π j,t
= Pj,t Yj,t − MCt Yj,t .

(37)

In addition to the stochastic discount factor β, firms will also discount their future
profits by φ. We also impose that the wholesale firms face the constraint that they can only
adjust prices following a Calvo-type rule. The wholesale firm has a φ probability of keeping
the price fixed in the next period and a 1 − φ probability of optimally determining its price.
Hence, a wholesale firm wants to maximize:
IF
Π j,t
= Et

∞

∑ ( βφ)s ( Pj,t Yj,t+s − MCt+s Yj,t+s ),

(38)

s =0

subject to production constraint (22), which is adjusted as:
!θ
Pt+s
Yj,t+s =
Yt+s .

(39)

Substitution the optimal production constraint (39) into profit function (38) gives:

∑ ( βφ)s ( Pj,t1−θ Ptθ+s − Pj,t−θ Ptθ+s MCt+s )Yt+s .

(40)

The first order condition with respect to Pj,t is then given by:

3.5. Capital Producing Firms
In the economy, all the capital is owned by the capital producing firm who adopts a
linear production function to produce capital goods. At the beginning of the period, the
capital producing firm buys I NVt of the final goods from the retail firm for investment

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

12 of 33

purposes. Because payments for these final goods must be made in advance, the capital
producing firms borrows QCF
t from the commercial bank to purchase the capital. Thus,
QCF
t = I NVt .

(44)

The loan in (44) must be paid in full plus interest with lending rate ItL . The capital
producing firms then combines investment goods and the existing capital stock to create
new capital goods Kt+1 . The new capital stock is then rented to wholesale firms at the rate
RtK . Recall that the dynamic of capital stocks is given in (3).
Taking the rental rate of capital RtK , the lending interest rate ItL , and the price of the
final goods Pt as given, the capital producing firm chooses the level of the capital stock so
as to maximize the profits to the household. The real profits of the capital producing firm
can be denoted as:
K
L
ΠCF
t = Rt Kt − (1 + It ) I NVt ,

(45)

and the value of the discounted stream of dividend payments to the household to be
maximized is then formulated as:
ΠCF = Et

∞

∑ βt ΛtH ΠCF
t ,

(46)

t =0

where it is assumed, as in [44,48], that the capital producing firm values future profits
according to the household’s intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption
ΛtH , i.e., the Lagrange multiplier of households’ utility maximization given in (A35). This
assumption is imposed because, in this model, the household and capital producing firm
can be considered as a single unit with respect to housing choices.
From (3), we get I NVi = Ki+1 − (1 − δ)Ki , and by substituting it into (46) together
with (45), we have the real profits function to be maximized:
ΠCF = Et

∞

∑ βi ΛiH ( RiK Ki − (1 + IiL )(Ki+1 − (1 − δ)Ki )).

i =0

By explicitly showing ΠCF
t at time t and t + 1, we have:
ΠCF = · · · + βt ΛtH ( RtK Kt − (1 + ItL )(Kt+1 − (1 − δ)Kt ))
βt+1 ΛtH+1 ( RtK+1 Kt+1 − (1 + ItL+1 )(Kt+2 − (1 − δ)Kt+1 )) + · · · ,
from which we obtain the first order condition with respect to Kt+1 as follows:

−ΛtH (1 + ItL ) + βEt ΛtH+1 ( RtK+1 + (1 − δ)(1 + ItL+1 )) = 0.
Since ΛtH = −Ct−σ /Pt from (A36), we then have:
C −σ
Ct−σ
(1 + ItL ) = − βEt t+1 ( RtK+1 + (1 − δ)(1 + ItL+1 )).

(47)

3.6. Banks
The commercial banks receive deposits Dt from households at the beginning of each
period. These deposits are managed by the banks to finance loans to wholesale firms for
IF in (25), and to the capital
paying wages claim, which for a representative firm j it is Q j,t
B
producing firm for investment QCF
t in (44). Therefore, total lending Qt provided by the
bank is:

QtB = QtIF + QCF
t = k Q Wt Lt + I NVt .

(48)

As refinancing via the central bank is more expensive than refinancing via deposits,
i.e., ItCB > ItD , bank will only demand central bank funding to fill the gap between the
supply of deposits Dt and the maximum amount of total external lending QtB . If the total

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

13 of 33

lending is bigger than deposits, i.e., there is a shortfall in funding, bank borrows from the
CB
central bank QCB
t with a net interest rate It .
Bank’s liabilities comprise of loans from the central bank QCB
t , bank deposits Dt , and
bank’s equity Nt , while bank’s assets consist of central bank reserves TRt , loans to firms
QtB , and bonds BtB as risk-free asset. Thus, the bank’s balance sheet is provided by:
QtB + TRt + BtB = QCB
t + Dt + Nt .

(49)

As total reserves TRt is a portion ψ of deposit, i.e., TRt = ψDt , and by (48), bank’s
balance sheet (49) is then rewritten as:
B
CB
QtIF + QCF
t + Bt = Qt + (1 − ψ ) Dt + Nt .

(50)

Note that Nt captures the bank’s equity, which is mainly driven by the interest rate
premia. Since commercial bank lends their equity, households’ deposits, and funds from
the central bank to the production sector, then the bank’s equity evolves according to the
following equation:
Nt+1 = (1 + ItL ) Nt + ( ItL − ItD ) Dt + ( ItL − ItCB ) QCB
t .

(51)

In (51), ItL − ItD and ItL − ItCB denote the interest rate premia from deposits and central
bank funds, respectively, by assuming that ItL ≥ ItD and ItL ≥ ItCB .
The bank’s revenues come from equity (1 + ItL ) Nt , loans to wholesale firms
(1 + ItCB ) QtIF = k Q (1 + ItCB )Wt Lt , loans to capital production firms (1 + ItL ) QCF
=
t
(1 + ItL ) I NVt , and bonds (1 + ItB ) BtB . Meanwhile, the bank’s liabilities come from deposits (1 + ItD ) Dt and central bank loans (1 + ItCB ) QCB
t . Therefore, the bank’s profit to
be maximized is formulated as:
B
B
Π B = (1 + ItL ) Nt + (1 + ItCB ) QtIF + (1 + ItL ) QCF
t + (1 + It ) Bt

− (1 + ItD ) Dt − (1 + ItCB ) QCB
t , (52)
subject to bank’s balance sheet (50). From (50), we may substitute QCB
t as follows:
IF
CF
B
QCB
t = Qt + Qt + Bt − (1 − ψ ) Dt − Nt .

Thus, the bank’s profit (52) becomes:
B
B
Π B = (1 + ItL ) Nt + (1 + ItCB ) QtIF + (1 + ItL ) QCF
t + (1 + It ) Bt
B
− (1 + ItD ) Dt − (1 + ItCB )( QtIF + QCF
t + Bt − (1 − ψ ) Dt − Nt ). (53)

The banks aim to determine the loan interest rate ItL and the deposits interest rate ItD
in order to maximize their profit (53). Instead of maximizing (53) with respect to ItL and ItL ,
it will be much easier differentiating (53) with respect to (1 + ItL ) and (1 + ItD ). Doing so,
we respectively obtain:

(54)

We derive (54) and (55) by considering that QCF
t is a function of (1 + It ) and Dt is a
D
function of (1 + It ). Next, we follow an approach in [44] by defining the coefficient of
interest elasticity for loan supply to the wholesale firm φL and that for deposits supply to
households φD as follows:

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

φL =

∂(1 + ItL ) QCF

(56)

φD =

1 + ItD
∂Dt

D
∂(1 + It ) Dt

(57)

Thus, by reformulating (54) and (55) in terms of φL in (56) and φD in (57), we obtain
the optimal rates of loan and deposits:
1 + ItL =

φL (1 + ItCB ) I NVt
,
Nt + (1 + φL ) I NVt

(58)

1 + ItD =

φD (1 − ψ)(1 + ItCB )
.
1 + φD

(59)

It is shown in (58) and (59) that loan and deposit rates depend positively on refinance
rate from the central bank ItCB . It is also known that ItL depends negatively on the ratio of
bank’s equity and investment Nt /I NVt .
3.7. The Central Bank
ItCB

While the rate of government bonds ItB follows the interest rate on central bank funding
in the way that:
ItB = ItCB + ∆ B ,

(60)

where ∆ B > 0 is the fixed spread, the nominal interest rate on CBDC ItE is set by the central
bank. In the case of a non-interest-bearing CBDC, the central bank sets ItE = 0. In order to
use CBDC as a policy instrument, for an interest-bearing CBDC, the interest rate on CBDC
strictly follows the interest rate on central bank funding with an individual rule-based
determination, as suggested by Gross & Schiller [8]:


N̄ − Nt
E
CB
E
It = It − ∆ + k N
.
(61)
N̄
The terms in brackets in (61) define the spread between the interest rates on central
bank funding ItCB and that of CBDC ItE , where ∆ E > 0 is the fixed spread, and Nt is the
bank’s equity with steady state value N̄. If Nt is below its steady state value N̄, then the
spread increases, meaning that the CBDC rate is much lower than the central bank rate.
In (61), the percentage deviation of banks’ equity from steady state ( N̄ − Nt )/ N̄ represents
the financial stress with k N ∈ (0, 1) denotes the reaction intensity.
The central bank sets the policy interest rate on central bank funding itCB according to
a Taylor-type rule. The policy rule is given in the following linear form:
B
T
ItCB = ρ R ItCB
−1 + (1 − ρ R )( R̄ + πt + φπ ( πt − π ) + φy (Yt − Ȳ ) + ut ,

(62)

where ρ R ∈ (0, 1) is the interest rate smoothing parameter, R̄ B is the steady state value
of the bonds interest rate, πt is the current inflation rate, π T is the central bank’s inflation target, yt is the output with steady state value Ȳ, φπ and φy are, respectively, relative weights on inflation deviation and the output gap, and ut is the shock of first-order
autoregressive process:
ut = ρu ut−1 + εut ,
(63)
where ρu ∈ (−1, 1) is the degree of persistence of the shock and εut ∼ N (0, σu ) is the error.
The central bank’s assets consist of government bonds holding BtCB , tax payment TAXt ,
and loans to the commercial banks QCB
t , whereas its liabilities comprise total reserves TRt
and currency supplied to households and firms in the forms of cash MtS and CBDC EtS . The
central bank’s balance sheet is thus formulated as:

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

15 of 33

S
S
(1 + ItB ) BtCB + TAXt + (1 + ItCB ) QCB
t = TRt − TRt−1 + Mt + Et .

(64)

Note that profits from bonds holding ItB BtCB and from loan ItCB QCB
t as well as lump
sum tax TAXt are then transferred to the government. Since TRt = ψDt and currencies
supplies can be given by MtS = Mt − µm Mt−1 and EtS = Et − µe Et−1 for cash and CBDC,
respectively, then (64) becomes:

(1 + ItB ) BtCB + TAXt + (1 + ItCB ) QCB
t = ψ ( Dt − Dt −1 )
+ ( Mt − µm Mt−1 ) + ( Et − µe Et−1 ), (65)
where µm and µe are the measure of nominal rigidity in the money supply process.
3.8. The Government
In the economy, the government purchases the final good from retail firms Gt , collects
taxes from households TAXt , and issues one-period risk-free bonds Bt . The total bonds
issued by government is given by:
Bt = BtB + BtCB ,

(66)

where BtB are bonds held by commercial bank and BtCB are those held by the central bank.
The government’s budget constraint is formulated as:
B CB
Pt Gt + (1 + ItB−1 ) Bt−1 = TAXt + Bt + ItCB QCB
t + It Bt ,

(67)

where we assume that the profits earned by the central bank from loans and bonds holding
are transferred to the government as fiscal authority. By (66), the budget constraint (67)
becomes:
B
B
CB
CB CB
Pt Gt + (1 + ItB−1 ) BtB−1 + BtCB
−1 = TAXt + Bt + (1 + It ) Bt + It Qt .

(68)

The government’s spending can be a constant fraction k G ∈ (0, 1) of output of the
final goods:
Gt = k G Yt ,
(69)
and since output is divided into consumption, investment, and government spending, then
the economy-wide budget constraint is expressed as:
Yt = Ct + I NVt + Gt .

(70)

4. Log-Linearization
One easy and common approach to solve and analyze DSGE models is to approximate the nonlinear equations characterizing the equilibrium with the corresponding
log-linearized equations. The principle is to employ a first order Taylor approximation
around a particular point (usually a steady state value) to replace the nonlinear equations
with their approximations, which are linear in the log-deviations of the variables. In this
work, we follow a log-linearization method proposed by Uhlig [49].
Let Xt be the value of variable at time t and X̄ be the steady state value of Xt . The
log-linearized form of Xt , denoted by xt , is defined as:
xt = ln Xt − ln X̄ = ln

Xt
.
X̄

(71)

Since the first order Taylor approximation of function h = h( x ) around x = a is given
by h( x ) ≈ h( a) + h0 ( a)( x − a), and thus for h( Xt ) = ln( Xt / X̄ ) we have h0 ( Xt ) = 1/Xt ,
then the approximation of Xt around its steady state value X̄ in (71) is xt ≈ ( Xt − X̄ )/ X̄,
from which we obtain the equivalency:
Xt ≈ X̄ (1 + xt ).

(72)

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

16 of 33

Alternatively, as from (71) we get ln Xt = xt + ln X̄, then by taking the exponent of
both sides, we obtain Xt ≈ X̄e xt . By fact that Taylor approximation provides e xt ≈ 1 + xt ,
then we again reclaim (72).
The nonlinear equations characterizing the equilibrium conditions of the model are
presented in Section 3. The log-linearized version of these equations can be found in
Appendix A.
5. Calibration
In this section, we examine the general equilibrium effects of the introduction of
an interest-bearing CBDC on the macroeconomic. In particular, we inspect the effect of
transaction costs, required reserves ratio, productivity shock, and monetary policy shock
through impulse response functions. An illustrative calibration of the model is performed
for Indonesia as a middle-income country. Other conventional parameters values are taken
from relevant references.
The intertemporal discount factor is β = 0.985, and the relative risk aversion coefficient is
σ = 0.5. Both values are in line with estimates for developing countries [44]. According to [8],
elasticity coefficients of having CBDC, cash, and deposits are set to ηe = ηm = ηd = 0.95. The
relative utility weights or preference parameters of CBDCs, cash, and deposits are assigned to
αe = αm = αd = 0.125, while that of labor time is αl = 3.409. The coefficient relates to Frisch
elasticity of labor supply is ϕ = 0.276 [43].
In the production sector, as is standard in the literature, the depreciation rate of
physical capital is δ = 0.034 and the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods is
θ = 10. The elasticity of output with respect to capital is set to be α = 0.33 as in [38]. These
values are consistent with estimates for developing countries. The portion of total wages
borrowed from bank, i.e., the strength of the cost channel, is taken to be k Q = 0.75 [44]. In
price determination mechanism, we assume that there is a φ = 0.779 probability of keeping
the price fixed in the next period, and thus a 1 − φ = 0.221 probability of optimally setting
the price [43].
In banking sector, we assume that the constant interest elasticity of the supply of loan
by the wholesale firm is φL = −0.5 and that of deposits by the household is φD = 0.5. For
the parameters related to the central bank, we use the values suggested by Chawwa [50]
based on Indonesia aggregate banking data, the steady state value of required reserves ratio
is ψ = 6.5%, the government spending share is k G = 9%, following the average Indonesia
government consumption relative to GDP, and the steady state value of the policy interest
rate is R̄ B = 1.8%. For Taylor rule parameters, we use the conventional values of φπ = 1.5
for the feedback coefficient on inflation and φy = 0.5 for the output gap coefficient, along
with a value of ρ R = 0.8 for interest rate smoothing parameter [43]. According to Bank
Indonesia, the inflation target is π T = 3%. The spread of bonds interest rate from central
bank rate is assumed to be ∆ B = 0.01 and that of CBDC interest rate is ∆ E = 0.005 [8].
Beside a fixed spread, the dynamics of CBDC interest rate depends also on financial stress
as expressed in (61). In this strategy, we set k N = 0.01 as the reaction intensity towards
financial stress [8]. Based on [51], we specify the measure of nominal rigidity in cash and
CBDC supply processes as µm = µe = 1. The degree of persistence in the monetary policy
shock is set to be ρu = 0.74 [52] and that of the productivity shock is φ A = 0.97 [53]. In the
case of liquidity shocks, we assume ρ M = 0.85 and ρ E = 0.9.
The steady state value of all variables are simultaneously calculated based on steady
state conditions derived from equations of motion in Appendix A. As initial values, we
set P̄ = 1, P̄ M = 1/3, Ā = 1, and Ī CB = 0.01. Description and value of all parameters are
summarized in Table 1.

6. Policy Analysis
In this section, we present the simulation result of the model to explore the responses
of variables with respect to liquidity demand shock, productivity shock, and monetary
policy shock. We use Matlab Dynare to produce the impulse response functions with one
period is a quarter.
6.1. Effects of Liquidity Demand Shock
As stated in (9), consumptions by households are constrained by transaction cost.
The cost is a function of money velocity with two parameters a and b as given in (13)
and (14). Smaller a and b contributes cheaper transaction cost. However, the magnitude
of the cost depends also on the types of money, where in our case is either cash or CBDC,
whose velocities are determined by the model. To assess the effect of transaction costs,
we specify the following cost parameters: a M = a E = 1 and b M = bE = 1.5. By this
setting, we consider a situation where cash and CBDC have the same parameters values,
and thus the same transaction cost provided the velocities of cash and CBDC are identical.
In this simulation, we apply a negative shock on the transaction cost using CBDC as given
in (14) to indicate that CBDC has a lower transaction cost.
Figure 2 shows the impact of negative shock of CBDC transaction cost on several
relevant variables of the model. A negative shock is intended to decrease the transaction
cost using CBDC by 1%. When the shock hits, consumption purchases using CBDC increase
as the cost becomes cheaper, and consumption purchases using cash slightly decrease, see

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

18 of 33

Figure 2a. However, in total, consumption purchases decrease. This fact informs us that
households spend more CBDC in purchasing consumption goods, confirmed by a rise
in CBDC demand as a response of shock in Figure 2f, even though the rate of CBDC is
decreased by the shock as indicated by Figure 2d. In contrast to CBDC, the demand of
bank deposits is decreasing even though its rate is increasing, see Figure 2e,f. From the
perspective of price, a negative shock on CBDC cost is responded by a decrease in price
of goods using CBDC ptE in Figure 2g, which indicates that transaction using CBDC is
cheaper than using cash. However, the general price pt , which is aggregated from prices
of cash and CBDC in (19), does not respond the shock very much as it fluctuates around
its steady state value for all time. This small change in price is followed by a little drop in
inflation rate, see Figure 2c. From the view point of money velocity, the negative shock
of CBDC transaction cost is reacted by a decline in the velocity of CBDC as depicted by
Figure 2h.

The simulation results presented in this section, however, indicate that the issuance
of an interest-bearing CBDC has the potential to become a profitable means of liquidity
storage and to have an impact that does not harm the economy.
6.2. Effects of Productivity Shock
The effects of productivity shock on a number of main variables of the model are
presented in Figure 3. The productivity shock due to the technological advance causes a
rise in the values of the marginal products of labor and capital, and thus firms increase their
demand for production inputs, so investment level increased. When one percent shock in
productivity hits, the demand for labor increases more than 2% during the first two periods
as depicted in Figure 3a. The intensity of labor declines quickly toward steady state. In the
same figure, a similar hike in capital demand is shown, but with a more sloping rise and
fall. Increasing productivity implies that firms produce more outputs (up to 3% hike), but
operate more efficiently so the marginal costs decrease by about 2.5%, see Figure 3e.

Meanwhile, inflations slightly fall in the first ten periods as the production becomes
more efficient, see Figure 3f. A small drop in inflation rate causes an increase in the supply
of goods, thus leading to easing in monetary policy. A hike in goods production implies
a rise in the wage and capital return as indicated by Figure 3b. Thus, households tend to
use their time for consumption rather than saving, thus instantaneously decreasing the
holding of cash, CBDC, and deposit about 1% as informed in Figure 3g. Due to the decline
in inflation, the base policy rate which is governed by the Taylor rule also decreases. The
lower base policy rate induces to a direct decrease in the central bank refinance rate, which
in turn decreases the deposit and CBDC rates and thus the demand for bank deposits and
interest bearing CBDCs.
Due to an increased aggregate supply of output, the price level decreased by more
than 2%, see Figure 3h, followed by a small decrease in the inflation rate in the early periods.
The central bank responds with a decline of its policy rate followed by CBDC and banks
rates to make an economic contraction by reducing purchasing power. As the consequence,
bank capital is decreasing due to the decreasing loans and increased liability due to the
rising deposit rate. A decline of policy rate also implies the reduction of bond rate, thus
central banks and banks buy more bonds, as depicted in Figure 3i. As the result, the rising
interest rate makes consumption and investment decline. Both people and firms tend to
save their money in CBDC rather than the deposit due to the CBDC attributes of being a
risk-free asset. Decreasing consumption implies reduced firm productivity, thus reducing
the wage of the labor, moreover, the technology starting to deteriorate as the technology
keeps depreciating. As the sources of tax revenue decreased, see Figure 3d, government

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

20 of 33

spending also decreased. In the end, the aggregate demand will be reduced, thus the output
will also be declined.
These results aligned with [40,41]. Both of the results imply that CBDC would likely
make monetary policy more effective. It can be seen by the response of the central bank towards inflation using CBDC rate is effective. Moreover, households show that remunerated
CBDC is more attractive than bonds to fulfill their liquidity, so it enhances the monetary
policy effectiveness.
6.3. Effects of Monetary Policy Shock
Figure 4 depicts the effect of one percent increase in policy interest rate on several main
variables of the model. A hike in policy rate means an increase of the borrowing cost from
central bank, i.e., a decrease in funding provided by central bank. The dynamics of policy
rate are mimicked by the bond rate and the CBDC rate as they are determined according to
a fixed spread of the policy rate in (60) and (61). For CBDC, it is revealed that the financial
stress term expressed in percentage deviation of banks’ equity from steady state gives no
effect in this situation. A rise in policy rate is responded differently by the loan rate and
deposits rate as they have to be determined optimally according to (58) and (59). The loan
rate declines in the first period and increases in the half of remaining periods. While, the
deposits rate declines during the first four periods, following by rises toward its steady
state value.

The rise of CBDC rate immediately leads to the increase of CBDC demand and the
fall of deposits rate directly causes the drop of bank deposits holding. However, the rise of
bond rate is not followed by its demand. Bonds holding by bank and central bank drop by
23% and 13%, respectively, in response to monetary policy shock. These occurrences reveal

Mathematics 2022, 10, 1671

21 of 33

a fact that households already consider CBDC as an alternative instrument of liquidity to
bank deposits. Holding CBDC will increase the household’s overall liquidity, even though
liquidity marginal utility decreased. Therefore, it is more explaining why CBDC is more
attractive than the deposit. Since CBDC is remunerated, the households tend to convert
more CBDC rather than cash or deposits.
There is lag in monetary policy transmission due to the cost adjustment of investment
gradual response. In this lag period, households and firms tend to borrow money from
bank to consume and invest before the bank done adjusting the interest rate, respectively.
This lag explains why initially there is a short span increment in output when there is
increment in the policy rate. After that period, households tend to substitute deposit to cash
and CBDC due to the consideration of risk-free assets. CBDC also become an alternative to
fulfill liquidity demand. The reduction of the deposit implies that banks have reduced credit
supply, thus decreasing their lending power. As a result, there is a decrease in investment,
which implies reduced labor as well as wages. Households also tend to save rather than
take a loan. Reduced household and firm activity imply a reduction in purchasing power,
thus reducing consumption as well as tax revenue. Due to the reduction in tax revenue,
the government is also reducing its government spending. Reduced consumption and
government spending also imply there is an excess supply of goods, which reduces the
price level and inflation rate. Therefore, the reduction of aggregate demand reflects the
reduction of output.
6.4. Implementation of the Analytical Model
Given the models in Section 3, it shows that CBDC involves many interactions among
agents in the economy. Nonetheless, CBDC implementation itself brings both benefits and
consequences [54]. On the high-level, CBDC could increase payment efficiency [55–57],
monetary policy effectiveness [19,58,59], higher financial inclusion [60–62], and provide
traceability [63–65]. This is also supported by the growing technology [66–68], network
effect [17,69], the enthusiasm of CBDC [70–72], and cash inefficiency [73,74].
However, some consequences are the high cost of CBDC infrastructure [56,75], privacy
loss potential [76,77], internet coverage limitation [62,78], and electrical outage [79,80].
This could be worsened by cyberattack threats [81,82], bank disintermediation amid crisis
times [17], unprepared legal aspects [77,83], and private crypto-asset competitions [84–86].
Following the spirits of both CBDC benefits and consequences, we try to introduce
some of the implications. First, CBDC implementation would likely increase budget
spending due to its high cost of infrastructure and would disrupt innovation. Therefore,
proposing a public–private partnership (PPP) allows us to maintain innovation, and also
increase efficiency. The partnership could be with state-owned enterprises or private
entities. Second, implementing CBDC implies that people could access their money 24/7,
which means CBDC withdrawal could be conducted anytime/anywhere amid crisis times.
One idea is to implement the capacity on the CBDC wallet, so there it could limit the
withdrawal and will not create bank disintermediation. Third, implementing alternative
offline payment (e.g., token-based offline CBDC) implies that people need to be aware of
their private keys, otherwise they will lose access to their CBDC. To reduce the risk of losing
the whole CBDC, the wallet could be limited so it will reduce the severity of losing CBDC.
Fourth, implementing traceable CBDC implies that the central bank needs to govern the
legal aspect consisting of the amount of extracted information, CBDC issuance, and eligible
authority for CBDC operators. Those efforts are nothing but to maintain public trust. Fifth,
central banks need to provide any means of backup plan to prevent a single point of failure
risk. Preventing an outage is important because it could disrupt the whole financial system.
Sixth, the central banks must use permissioned DLT to gain sufficient accessibility amid a
decentralized system. Lastly, even though the central banks need to align their system to
achieve interoperability in cross-border transactions, central banks still need to maintain
their sovereignty.

7. Conclusions
The development of CBDC has been conducted by central banks across the world with
various progress and motivation. From that consideration, implementing CBDC would
likely to have macroeconomy consequences and monetary policy implication. However, it
needs a comprehensive approach to support monetary policy based on those impacts. We
have developed a medium size DSGE model to examine the interaction between CBDC and
other variables and to quantify the macroeconomic effects of CBDC issuance. The proposed
model consists of seven economic agents, namely households, retail firm, wholesale firms,
capital producing firm, commercial bank, the central bank, and the government.
The model consider an economy in which the households may consider CBDC as
a liquidity asset in addition to cash and bank deposits. The introduction of CBDC then
differentiates the amount of consumption and the price in terms of cash and CBDC. As
CBDC is designed to be an interest-bearing, CBDC may compete with cash in consumption process. The attractiveness of CBDC can also be appreciated at the lower transaction cost than cash. Thus, an interest-bearing CBDC can be considered as a profitable
transaction instrument.
We have used the model to explain the main macroeconomic variables responses
to a negative shock on CBDC transaction cost, as well as a positive supply shock, and a
positive shock to the base policy rate. Our findings confirm that CBDC offers a number of
macroeconomic benefits. A lower transaction cost offered by CBDC encourages households
to consume more using CBDC, and thus reducing the purchase using cash. The price
of goods counted in CBDC reduced, while the general price index is about in steady
state leading to a small fall in inflation. As responses to an increase of output due to a
productivity shock, we have shown that households use cash and CBDC in almost similar
manners by reducing the holding for consumption. Responding to a one percent increase
in the base policy rate, we have revealed that the dynamics of the policy interest rate is
directly followed by that of CBDC. Thus, the accumulation of CBDC can be controlled by
the policy rate.
As self-critical and possible limitations and shortcomings, our study considers only the
issuance of retail CBDCs. More general situation in which commercial banks are enabled to
provide loan to firms and to make settlement reserves in term of wholesale CBDCs will
be the future research work. Additionally, the assessment of CBDC issuance in an open
economy might be substantial to emerging countries as they have a significant portion
of exports.

The Lagrange function L H for the problem of maximization (1) subject to budget

L H = βt (UtH + ΛtH Ht ) + βt+1 Et (UtH+1 + ΛtH+1 Ht+1 ),

(A35)

The Lagrange function (A35) should be maximized with respect to consumption Ch,t ,
CBDC holding Eh,t , cash holding Mh,t , deposit holding Dh,t , labor time Lh,t , and capital

Note that terms in the right-hand side of (A36)–(A41) are independent of index h. It
means that expressions in the left-hand side are the same across households. Thus, from
now on, we will drop the index h from the expression. From (A36) we have ΛtH = −Ct−σ /Pt

Appendix C. Proof of Consumption and Price Indices
The households use either cash Mt or CBDC Et to purchase consumption goods. In
this case, the total consumption Ct can be seen as a composite consumption index using
Dixit–Stiglitz aggregator [47]:

Ct =

Consumption basket (A47) is analogous to the case where there exists non-tradable
(domestic) goods and imported goods. The equations defining CtM and CtE are:

To derive the cash and CBDC consumer price indices, now we will solve three optimization problems regarding the consumption levels CtM , CtE and Ct . First we solve
households’ cost minimization problem of using cash:
min

subject to consumption level using cash (A48). The Lagrangian of this problem is given by:

produces:

(A52)
ΛtM

By substituting (A52) into constraint (A48), we may reformulate the Lagrange multiplier as ΛtM = − PtM , and hence (A52) becomes:

where ΛtME is the corresponding Lagrange multiplier for this problem. Substitution (A55)
and (A56) back into (A47) provides the equivalent form of Lagrange multiplier ΛtME as
follows:
1

ΛtME = −(( PtM )1−ζ + ( PtE )1−ζ ) 1−ζ .
By denoting:
1

Pt = (( PtM )1−ζ + ( PtE )1−ζ ) 1−ζ ,

(A57)

we can then express (A55) and (A56) as:

Appendix D. Derivation of Phillips Curve
Note that all wholesale firms that fix their prices have the same markup on the same
∗ is the same for all the firms that
marginal cost. Thus, in all periods, the optimal price Pj,t
set their prices. Thus, the expression for price:

Pt =

By imposing steady state condition P̄ = P̄∗ , we obtain the log-linearized form of the
price equation:
pt = φpt−1 + (1 − φ) p∗t .

where we have applied steady state conditions P̄ = P̄∗ and θMC = (θ − 1) P̄ as indicated
in (42). Further, by approximation e x ≈ 1 + x, we have:

By (A18) we obtain:

(1 − βφ)Et

∞

∞

s =0

s =0

∑ ( βφ)s pt+s = pt−1 + Et ∑ ( βφ)s πt+s .

(A62)

∞

∑ ( βφ)s πt+s

s =1

∑ ( βφ)s (mct+s − pt+s ).

∑ ( βφ)s πt+s+1

∑ ( βφ)τ πt+τ + (1 − βφ)Et ∑ ( βφ)τ (mct+τ − pt+τ ).

(A64)

Replacing the last two terms in the right-hand side of (A63) by the left-hand side
of (A64) results:
p∗t = pt−1 + πt + (1 − βφ)(mct − pt ) + βφEt ( p∗t+1 − pt ).

(A65)

Combination of (A18) and (A60) gives:
πt

1−φ
and substitution into (A65) provides:
πt
= πt + (1 − βφ)(mct − pt ) + βφEt ( p∗t+1 − pt ).
1−φ
Finally we get the Phillips curve:
πt =

(1 − βφ)(1 − φ)
(mct − pt ) + βEt πt+1 .
