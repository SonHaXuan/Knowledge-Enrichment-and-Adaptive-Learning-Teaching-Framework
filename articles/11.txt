Abstract
This study examined the price and exchange rate hedging elasticity of
cryptocurrency demand in Nigeria. To achieve the objective, the study employed
Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ADRL) model to estimate both the short-run and
long-run response of demand to changes in crypto price, consumer income and
exchange rate. The Study found among others that cryptocurrency is demanded as
a financial asset (either as money for exchange purpose or asset for speculative
purpose). It was discovered that cryptocurrency price changes have significant
impact on cryptocurrency demand but price inelastic. Meaning that a percentage
changes in crypto price leads to less than proportionate change in cryptocurrency
demand. It was also discovered that Nigeria real exchange rate has negative
relationship with cryptocurrency demand meaning that as Naira real exchange rate
to dollar is falling, the demand for cryptocurrency is rising. Other factors that are
influencing cryptocurrency demand in Nigeria include consumer income,
cryptocurrency popularity, and inflation rate in the country. The study concludes that
while price plays an important role in cryptocurrency demand, fluctuations in
cryptocurrency demand is less than the fluctuation in its price. The implication is
that there are several other factors (structural issues) including real exchange rate
movement that influences demands for cryptocurrency other than its price that
policy makers should explore.

1. Introduction
To keep pace with the digitalized and globalized
twenty-first century, there is a constant revolution of
digital payment solutions around the globe (Urquhart,
2018; Joseph, 2020). One such revolution is the
emergence of virtual currency or what is known
today as cryptocurrency (Thompson, 2020).
Cryptocurrency emerged intending to solve
monetary and structural crisis rocking the global
economy particularly the global financial crisis of
2008, the rising inflation rate across the globe, the
masses over dependence on government backed
monetary system that is assumed not transparent
enough and enjoyed or manipulated by few
individuals to their advantages (Halaburda, et al,
2020).

The cryptocurrency economy is thus driven by the
belief in the power of the market and the need to
develop a monetary system that is not controlled by
the government, group of institutions, and few
powerful individuals but is decentralized such that
everyone within the ecosystem has a say in how the
monetary system is governed. Having a
decentralized cash system means that individuals
may engage in “monetary transactions” without any
third party involved (a peer-to-peer system) and
without any authority that would for instance conduct
a monetary policy (Halaburda et al, 2020).
Thus, the need to permit transactions between two or
more people without relying on a third party like banks
and where the transaction between the parties is not
only anonymous but are jointly agreed upon led to the

Joseph et al, 2022

introduction of cryptocurrency (Eloy, Juan, and
Manuel, 2020). The technology boasts zero
transaction cost including cross-border transaction,
cutting out the activities of middlemen that drives
inflation, and contributing to community-based
finance system like crowdfunding (Yaser and
Seyedjavad, 2019; Halaburda and Sarvary, 2016;
Andolfatto, 2018; Haeringer and Halaburda, 2018).
However, despite the obvious advantages of
cryptocurrency transactions it has several drawbacks
including exposure to hackers, facilitates money
laundering, lack of regulation (or difficult to regulate),
poor scalability, and high volatility in its price which
makes it difficult to function as a medium of exchange
and store of value (Haeringer and Halaburda, 2018,
Thompson, 2020). Beyond the obvious mentioned
disadvantages, several literatures have argued that
the ecosystem has created more problems
particularly for the developing countries than it
proposed to solve. For instance, the ecosystem
proposed a system that facilitates zero transaction
cost for cross border remittances, facilitates faster
international peer-to-peer transaction, and increases
financial inclusion but has increased the incidence of
capital flight in developing countries, money
laundering, and exchange rate crisis which in a way is
blamed for the rising inflation across developing
countries (Yaser and Seyedjavad, 2019; Nurgun and
Holya, 2018).
The question average regulators and academicians
are asking is why the sudden surge in cryptocurrency
investment and transaction? Several studies using
consumer behaviour theory have examined what is
driving cryptocurrency demand particularly given the
obvious fact that cryptocurrency price is subject to a
high level of volatility (Urquhart, 2018; Yaser and
Seyedjavad, 2019; Bolt and Van Oordt, 2020;
Nurgun and Holya, 2018). Most of these studies
have found that the need for an anonymous
transaction, speculative purposes, online medium of
exchange, international transaction, among others
are the leading determinant of cryptocurrency
demand (Arias-Oliva, Pelegrín-Borondo, and MatíasClavero, 2019; Anna, 2021).
One aspect that has been largely ignored in literature
is the role of cryptocurrency price (volatility) in crypto
demand. Evidence has revealed that one of the
criteria that most industry leaders use to dissuade
people from investing in cryptocurrency is because of
the volatility of cryptocurrency price (making the asset
risky such that investor can loss its investment within
hours or days), yet studies on consumer behaviour
towards cryptocurrency have largely ignored
cryptocurrency demand responses to its price
volatility. Demand for money theories of Tobin,
Baumol, and Friedman all argued that the relationship
between demand for money as means of exchange is
negative to interest rate while demand for money as
financial instruments like bonds, shares, and

Page|2

portfolios are positively related to interest rate (Guru,
2021). Specifically, Baumol argued that demand for
money as financial instruments rises as the
instrument value (price) rises but demand for money
as means of exchange is inversely related to its price
(Guru, 2021; Gandal, Hamrick, Moore, and Oberman,
2018).
Whether this is true for cryptocurrency demand is yet
to be established empirically and the degree of
cryptocurrency price elasticity is well unknown despite
the growing body of literature on the issue. A recent
survey cited by Investment.com revealed that most
Nigerians are fast embracing cryptocurrency because
of exchange rate crisis in the country. “Most people
use cryptocurrency to send money to their relatives
abroad, pay schools fees abroad and make different
transaction that the official market/ channels could not
allow them do because of scarcity and stringent
bureaucratic process of accessing dollar in the
countries” – Investment.com. Establishing such a
relationship is important to policymakers who would
aim to introduce alternatives digital currencies like
Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that are not
susceptible to such price volatility and are backed by
the government.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Conceptual Literature
2.1.1 Cryptocurrency Definitional Issue
Since the emergence of the first cryptocurrency
(bitcoin) from the work of one Satoshi Nakamoto
(2008) in his or her seminal paper, ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-toPeer Electronic Cash System’, the concept has been
variously defined and explained with each discipline
adopting the definition that best meet their goals and
objectives.
Conventionally,
cryptocurrency
is
regarded as a part of the virtual currencies that are not
backed by any central government or monetary
authority. Technically, cryptocurrency are those digital
currency that adopts the formula of cryptography for
the creation and management of its currency units
(Majumder, Routh, and Singha, 2019). It is blockchain
technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P)
commerce, individualization of products, and
flexibilization of production methods. For a variety of
reasons, this wave gained traction after the global
financial crisis a decade ago (Gupta et al, 2020). For
example, these technologies embrace a peer-to-peer
mechanism and effectively eliminate the “middleman”,
like banks. Because with cryptocurrency, there is no
need for credit and debit card, it just requires smart
phone and the internet and two people can
successfully conduct transaction.
Cryptocurrency are built on blockchain technologies
and enable the creation of money without central
banks or any financial institution. A blockchain is
technology of digital ledger of transactions that is
distributed across the network of computer systems

2
DOI:10.53790/aemr.v2i2.34

Joseph et al, 2022

on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains
several transactions, and every time new transaction
occurs a record of that transaction is added to every
participant. This decentralized database managed by
every participant is referred Distributed Ledger
Technology (DLT). Thus, cryptocurrency represents
both technology and technology enabled service.
Whether cryptocurrency is money (used as means of
exchange) or financial instruments remains a debated
topic in literature.
2.1.2 Cryptocurrency as Money or Financial
Instrument
Cryptocurrency is largely abstract in nature. Some
literature has argued that cryptocurrency is money in
the sense that they can be exchanged via peer-topeer (Irina, 2018). However, cryptocurrency does not
fulfill the basic characteristics of currency; for
example, it is not backed by any issuer (Irina, 2018;
David and Chuen, 2015). This argument has been
refuted in some corners who argues that
cryptocurrency is essentially not much different from
standard currency. They argued that only small
portion of our currency are in cash; most of the money
is in electronic form, which means only the data stored
on a computer. The monetary system operates in the
existence of trust between monetary authority and the
masses. The cryptocurrency is also built on trust
between or among its users (Benjamin, 2013). Others
argued that cryptocurrency is not money because it is
susceptible to high volatility. This claim is relatively
trashed in some quarters also who believe that stable
coins like Tether (USDT) value is not volatile, but the
fact that its value is pegged to another currency is an
issue yet unresolved in literature.
The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN) argued that every exchange that involves
the exchange of cryptocurrency with traditional fiat
money should be regulated same way as money
(Irina, 2018), which invariably means that
cryptocurrency can serve as both money and other
instrument depending on the usage. While some
countries like Japan for the purpose of regulation have
recognized bitcoin – the mother of all cryptocurrencies
as money, it remains a puzzle for the classification
given that other cryptocurrencies are not recognized
as money within Japan. Some other countries have
recognized and classified cryptocurrency as
commodity that can be owned by individuals and can
be used for exchange through a barter system.
Example of such countries include Israel, Australia,
and Estonia (Yilmaz and Hazar, 2018; Irina, 2018;
Sun et al, 2020). Most cryptocurrency are issued like
stocks in “initial coin offerings” and used to represent
shares in online projects which means cryptocurrency
used in this form is viewed as financial instrument.
Germany also recognizes cryptocurrency as financial
instrument which means it can serve as currency,
commodity, and securities including various statistical
indicators (Irina, 2018).

2.1.3 Cryptocurrency, Central
Currency and Electronic Money.

Bank

Digital

With the surge in cryptocurrency across the globe
numbering more than 13, 000 (Connor, 2021), the
central banks across the globe have started rolling out
their own digital currency. But what is the difference
between Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and
cryptocurrency? CBDC is essentially the digital
version of the nation fiat currency – its value is tied to
the value of the nation fiat currency. It is essentially
related to cryptocurrency in that both are digital coins
but essentially different since CBDC are regulated by
monetary authority and are pegged to the value of the
country fiat currency. Cryptocurrency is not regulated,
not backed by any monetary authority, and designed
such that the value can be rising largely since most of
the cryptocurrency have a fixed supply in context and
this explain why most people demand for
cryptocurrency as financial instrument (Connor, 2021,
Irina, 2018; Sun et al, 2020).
The next question that rightly comes to mind is how
does CBDC differs from our conventional electronic
money in our bank account? Duncan (2021) pointed
out that while the existing electronic naira, dollars,
pounds, etc., are created by commercial banks
lending within fractional reserve banking systems with
the assets and liabilities involved are held on the
balance sheets of these banks and their clients. In
contrast, CBDC are solely issued by the central bank
and liability would be held by the central banks. Thus,
the central bank keeps its own reserve to back the
liability on the digital currency.
CBDC has several advantages over electronic notes,
these include low or no transaction cost, fast and
efficient transaction, facilitates more efficient
international remittances, liability of the central bank,
more secure payment system, facilitates financial
inclusion, prevent fraud and money laundry, among
others (Connor, 2021). But beyond being backed by a
government and a monetary authority, most people
have argued that CBDC are not in any way different
from stable cryptocurrency coin like BSD and USDT
coins since both are pegged to a fiat currency.
2.2 Trends in cryptocurrency Investment.
Since the surge of cryptocurrency in the global
financial ecosystem, the value of cryptocurrency has
skyrocketed particularly Bitcoin which has seen it
value rose to $68, 000 before it falls below $40, 000
in January 2022 (Coinmaketcap, 2021). The rise in
its value stem from several factors including but not
limited to its ability to facilitates instant peer-to-peer
transaction that bypass the conventional banking
system, even across borders, without the need for a
bank that could block the transaction or charge a fee
(Zhu et al, 2021; Sun et al., 2020). As seen in Figure
1, cryptocurrency has seen a tremendous growth in
2021 with more than 7000 alternate coins rolled out
in 2021 (Coinmarketcap, 2021).

Joseph et al, 2022

One noticeable feature from Figure 1 is the level of
volatility associated with cryptocurrency. For
instance, Bitcoin price initially hit an all-time high of
$64, 000 in April 2021 and slide back in to as low as
$30,000 in July 2021. That same period as seen in
Figure 1 witnessed a downward trend in bitcoin

demand which consistent with portfolio demand
theories of Tobin, Baumol, and Friedman (Guru,
2021). It is important to note that this study treats
cryptocurrency as a financial instrument rather than
as money since it is not legally recognized globally
as medium of exchange.

2.3 Empirical Literature
Several Literatures have made efforts to investigate
cryptocurrency in relation to consumer behaviour,
particularly as it relates to what is driving the
demand for cryptocurrency (Arias-Oliva et al, 2019;
Gupta et al, 2020; Sun et al, 2020). Other studies
have focused more on examining the factors
responsible for the price volatility or what is driving the
price of cryptocurrencies (Biais et al, 2018; Cheah and
Fry, 2015; Gandal, et al, 2018). In terms of factors
driving cryptocurrency, literature suggested several
factors including but not limited to profitability
purposes, investment, risk tolerance, technology, the
need to engage in anonymous transaction, online
medium of exchange, international transaction, as a
form of hedge against inflation and exchange rate

Page|4

depreciation, among others (Arias-Oliva et al, 2019;
Gupta, Gupta, Mathew, and Sama, 2020).
Literature on cryptocurrencies price manipulation,
elasticity, and volatility have suggested that
cryptocurrency price is influenced by several factors
including but not limited to demands (the different
uses agents are putting cryptocurrency to use), the
supply, demands, trends, other commodities prices
including stock prices among others (Poyser (2017)
categorize cryptocurrency drivers into internal and
external factors. He argued that demand and supply
of cryptocurrency are the two key internal factors
driving cryptocurrency price while attractiveness
(popularity), legalization (adoption), and few

macroeconomics factors (stock price, gold price, etc.)
are the external drivers of cryptocurrency price. This
is as summarized in Figure 3.

3. Methodology
3.1 Model Specification

To determine price elasticity of cryptocurrency to
demand for cryptocurrency we follow the work of
Beenstock et al (1999), Alberini and Filippini (2011),
and Espey and Espey (2004), where cryptocurrency
demand is modeled as a function of cryptocurrency
price and vector of other variables influencing
cryptocurrency demand as in equation (1):
𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑒,𝑡 , 𝑙𝑛𝑍𝑛,𝑡 )

(1)

Where 𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡 represents the log of aggregate
cryptocurrency demand, 𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑒,𝑡 represents price of
cryptocurrency, 𝑙𝑛𝑍𝑛,𝑡 and represents vector of other
variables affecting demand for cryptocurrency. For
sake of simplicity, the study will follow the like of
Halaburda and Sarvary (2016) and Andolfatto (2018)
and develop cryptocurrency price index using price of
ten (10) most traded cryptocurrency as of January
2022 to capture cryptocurrency price.
A static model as in equation (1) assume that
cryptocurrency demand is instantaneously adjusted
toward long-term equilibrium when the cryptocurrency
price (return on asset) or other variables changes.
Such static model will fail to capture the model
dynamic
since
cryptocurrency
economy
is
technological driven, there is need to capture such
effects when investigating long-term price and output
elasticities. It is assumed that the actual
cryptocurrency demand change between two periods
t − 1 and t is only the partial fraction of the difference
between the long-term desired cryptocurrency use at
year t and the actual demand at year t − 1.
Consequently, λ represents the rate of adjustment
between any two time periods toward the long-term
equilibrium demand. If λ equals 1, then the desired

Page|5

cryptocurrency use becomes identical to the actual
demand.
𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡 − 𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡−1 = λ(𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷 ∗ 𝑡 − 𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡−1 )

(2)

The aggregated long-term effects of a price elasticity
can be estimated with equations (3) to (5). Equation
(3), following the work of Alberini and Filippini (2011)
expressed the desired cryptocurrency as a function of
cryptocurrency price and vector of other variables and
𝜖𝑡 represents error term.
𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷 ∗ 𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑒,𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝑙𝑛𝑍𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡

(3)

If we substitute equation (3) into equation (2), we
obtain equation (4) that is dynamic.
𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡 = (1 − 𝜆)𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡−1 + 𝜆𝛼0 + 𝜆𝛼1 𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑒,𝑡
+ 𝜆𝛼2 𝑙𝑛𝑍𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 (4)
𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡 = 𝜙𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡−1 + 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑒,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑙𝑛𝑍𝑡
+ 𝜀𝑡 (5)
Where, (1 − 𝜆) = 𝜙, 𝜆𝛼0 = 𝛽0 ; 𝜆𝛼1 = 𝛽1 ; 𝜆𝛼2 = 𝛽2 ,
where 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 are short-term price elasticity and
vector of other cryptocurrency demand variables.
Literature suggested that exchange rate depreciation
in developing countries like Nigeria is a key variable
in cryptocurrency demand either as asset or money
(medium of exchange). If we modify equation (4) to
include exchange rate, Cryptocurrency news (an
indicator of popularity), income and inflation rate, we
can have equation (5).
𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡 = 𝜙𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑟𝐷𝑡−1 + 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑒,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑙𝑛𝑅𝐸𝑋𝐶𝑡
+ 𝛽3 𝑙𝑛𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑠𝑒,𝑡 + 𝛽4 𝑙𝑛𝑅𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑡 + 𝛽5 𝐼𝑁𝐹𝑡

estimate both the short-run and long-run effects

(Pesaran, Shin, & Smith, 2001). Equation (5) can be
expressed in the ARDL form as given in equation (6):

Where ln is logarithm function, ∆ is the first difference
operator, and 𝛼0 is the drift component. The
expression with summation sign (𝛽1 − 𝛽6 ) represents
the short-run dynamics of the model, while the
coefficients (𝜑1 − 𝜑6 ) represents the long-run
relationship and ℰ𝑡 is the serially uncorrelated

disturbance with zero mean and constant variance.
Once it is established that there exists a long-run
relationship through the application of bounds

ARDL model can be estimated as given in equation

3.2 Data and Sources
The study employed monthly data on cryptocurrency
(Bitcoin) price and demand between January 2017 to
October
2021
using
data
from
https://coinmarketcap.com/, the study following the
work of
Kristoufek (2015) and data from
http://www.coindesk.com/price identified the use
purposes of cryptocurrency. For trading or speculative
purpose and for exchange. Thus, the the ratio
between demand for cryptocurrency for speculative
purpose (asset – trading, and conversion of fiat to
volatile crypto) and demand for cryptocurrency as
exchange transactions (conversion of fiat or volatile
crypto to stable coin for exchange or peer-to-peer
transaction) is provided and used in cryptocurrency
demand. Data on real
GDP, inflation rate, and exchange rate for the case of
Nigeria is sourced from IMF databank while Google
trends news at http://trends.google.com/ is used to
measure news (popularity) effects on cryptocurrency
demand. All the data are converted to monthly where
they are available in other frequencies like daily,
weekly, or quarterly. Also, some database has already
aggregated the crypto data into monthly data (see
https://ng.investing.com/crypto/).

series are stationary at level. The stationarity result is
presented in Table (2) using both Augmented Dickey
Fuller (ADF) test and Philip Perron (PP) test. The
result as in Table (2) reveals that all the series either
integrated of order zero, I(0) or integrated of order
one, I(1). Since the series are fractionally integrated
the choice of ARDL is further justified. The study
employed a combination of Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), Schwarz Criterion (SC), and HannanQuinn Criterion (HQ) for the appropriate lag selection
and where there is a conflict between the various
criteria, AIC overrides others.
To establish the existence of long-run relationship
between and among the series, the study followed the
suggestion of Enders (2010) and Peters, Yaaba,
Adetoba, Tomologu, and Tonuchi (2020) to conduct
three basic check test; the bounds co-integration test
to validate the existence of long-run relationship, the
Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation test, and CUSUM
square test to check stability of the model. The result
as in Table (2) reveals that all the series either
integrated of order zero, I(0) or integrated of order
one, I(1). Since the series are fractionally integrated
the choice of ARDL is further justified. The study
employed a combination of Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), Schwarz Criterion (SC), and HannanQuinn Criterion (HQ) for the appropriate lag selection
and where there is a conflict between the various
criteria, AIC overrides others.

The series was first subjected to unit root test since
economic modeled is built on the assumption that

To establish the existence of long-run relationship
between and among the series, the study followed the
suggestion of Enders (2010) and Peters et al (2020)
to conduct three basic check test; the bounds cointegration test to validate the existence of long-run
relationship, the Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation
test, and CUSUM square test to check stability of the
model.

Page|7

The basic check of long-run relationship and stability
of the models reveals that all the models have longrun relationship at 1% level of significance, given that
the F-statistics of the bounds test is greater than the
1% critical value for each of the models as seen in
both Table 3 and 4. The data as in Table 3 revealed
that demand for cryptocurrency is inelastic to the price
of cryptocurrency as revealed by the price index in
Table 3 both in the long-run and short-run. In order
words, a proportionate change in crypto price will

leads to less than proportionate change in demand
both at the long-run and short-run. The data revealed
positive relationship between crypto demand and
price in the long-run which is consistent with Tobin,
Baumol, and Friedman Portfolio investment theory.
This suffice that most people are demanding for
cryptocurrency for investment purpose rather than
means of exchange which is consistent with the
findings of Kristoufek (2015). However, as revealed in
Table 3, the first model short-run result revealed a
negative relationship between asset price and
demand indicating that more people are demanding
for cryptocurrency in the short-run as money for
exchange rather than financial instrument. But, when
exchange
rate
and
cryptocurrency
hipping
(popularity) was introduced the price and demand
relationship becomes consistent with the long-run
relationship.

Similarly, the result as in Table 3 revealed that as
Nigeria currency is depreciating and exchange rate of
naira to dollar is falling, the demand for cryptocurrency
is rising and significant at 5 percent level of
significance. The implication is that exchange rate
depreciation is among the factors driving Nigerians
into cryptocurrency. As a last ditch, the study
introduced cryptocurrency popularity into the model
as in Model 3. It was revealed that introducing
popularity into the model does not change the model
parameters sign, but it makes the price of Bitcoin not
significant except at 10 percent. However, the sign
and magnitude remain unchanged. It was also seen
that cryptocurrency popularity has strong positive
significant impact of cryptocurrency demand.

The global data as in Table 4 is relatively consistent
with the result from the data in Table 3. Data from
Table 4 reveals that demand for cryptocurrency is
positively inelastic and significant at 5 percent level of
significance. Cryptocurrency price has positive
significant impact on cryptocurrency demand in the
long-run further indicating that cryptocurrency
demand is largely influenced by speculative purpose
or the use of crypto as financial instrument rather than
as conventional money. However, price has a
negative relationship with crypto demand in the shortrun indicating that demand for crypto in the short-run

Page|8

is largely influenced by exchange purposes consistent
with Nigeria data. Lastly, popularity of cryptocurrency
also has positive impact on crypto demand in both
short-run and long-run for global economy.
5. Conclusion and Policy implication
The study revealed that cryptocurrency price has
positive significant impact on cryptocurrency
demand, but the demand is price inelastic which
means that while cryptocurrency demand might
fluctuate relative to price, the relative response is

lower to the price volatility. Similarly, the more
popular or the more hipping a cryptocurrency
received the higher the demand for it. This explain
why some meme coins with huge community rise in
15,000 percent despite being a meme coin. For the
case of Nigeria, we see that exchange rate hedging
plays an important role in cryptocurrency demand as
people are trying to save their money value against
dwindling value of naira they then to invest in
cryptocurrency with more stability and higher yield.
Most people would prefer to put their money in
stable coins like Tether since its value is equivalent
to US dollar and saves the investor from the inflation
and exchange rate crises. The finding is consistent
with economic theory particularly the portfolio
investment theories of Tobin, Baumol, and
Friedman and Keynes demand for money theory.
We conclude that cryptocurrency demand in Nigeria
and elsewhere is dominated by speculative motives.
In order words, most people using cryptocurrency
are speculating that the price will rise, and they will
make gain which explain why demand for
cryptocurrency rises when the price rises.

The implication is that crypto enthusiast is not likely
to be deterred by cryptocurrency price volatility. It
also means that Central Bank Digital Currency
(CBDC) which are being rolled out by different
central banks might struggle to compete with
cryptocurrency without other value proposition. One
of the arguments against cryptocurrency is that the
currency is susceptible to high volatility and as
revealed by our result crypto enthusiast are rarely
bordered by that fact. One can argue that most
crypto investors are risk loving individuals who
derives more utility from higher investment gains
and higher risk of investment loss compared to risk
averse consumers who derives more utility from
lower yield asset with minimal risk. Secondly, stable
coins like Tether (USDT) value is pegged to dollar
which means holding USDT is like holding dollar and
this can be both used as medium of exchange and
store value which Bitcoin has been accused of
failing to achieve making cryptocurrency to be a step
closer to fulfilling the medium of exchange feature of
money.

Also, giving the high inflation rate across the globe,
and the fact that most stable coin offers a guarantee
on investment between 5-20% implies that even the
risk averse investor will be willing to stake their
investment in guaranteed cryptocurrency stake
which should further concern regulators particularly
from developing country in attempt to reduce
incidence of financial instability and capital flight in
the country. There is need to reevaluate the CBDC
value proposition probably to include interest
yielding savings that can be managed by the deposit
money bank.
